Today, CoV Index is launching to provide a map of Coronavirus Science.

Recently, many publishers have opened their research archives in order to support Coronavirus Science.

We are building on this academic good will by providing an index to permit experts to usefully navigate this new collection of research.

Our work leverages network analysis, bibliometrics, computer-human interaction, and computational linguistics methods.

CoV Index is lead by Dr. Ian Dennis Miller, who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto.
