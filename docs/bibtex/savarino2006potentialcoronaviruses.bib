    abstract = {Coronavirus replication offers several attractive targets for chemotherapy. These include: viral entry (inhibited by chloroquine and peptides); viral RNA (targeted by antisense approaches/RNAi); the main protease 3CLpro (inhibited by peptidic molecules such as HIV-1 protease inhibitors and miscellaneous compounds); the accessory protease(s) PLpro(s) (inhibited by zinc ions); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid and antisense approaches); and helicase (inhibited by bananins). Chloroquine and HIV-1 protease inhibitors (with well-known toxicity profiles) should be considered for clinical tests if severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) re-emerges; however, there are other attractive compounds. Lessons should be learnt from AIDS research for choosing the best strategies. Â© 2006 Informa UK Ltd.},
