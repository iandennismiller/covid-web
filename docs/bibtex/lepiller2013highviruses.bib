    abstract = {Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of acute infections in humans. However, the burden of certain respiratory viruses, such as coronaviruses, and the relevance of viral coinfections remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the distribution and seasonal occurrences of respiratory viruses detected by multiplex molecular assay in 6,014 samples from 2008 to 2011 in a French hospital. We assessed the detection frequencies of 14 respiratory viruses and their clinical impact in immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, we explored the preferential association patterns between respiratory viruses in multiple infections. Our results indicated that human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV) and coronavirus (HCoV) were frequently detected in respiratory samples (48.81% and 11.74% of infected samples, respectively), and the detection frequencies of these viruses were further increased in immunosuppressed patients. The most common subtypes of HCoV were HCoV-229E (33.80%) and HCoV-HKU1 (32.39%). A sharp increase in the detection frequencies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 over several months suggested that these subtypes were epidemic in our population. In immunosuppressed patients, HCoV contributed to upper respiratory tract infections (52%). Evidence did not support lower respiratory tract infections exclusive to a unique HCoV infection. In multiply infected individuals, determined in 6.3% of samples, HRV/EV and HCoV were detected in 33.29% and 22.90% of samples, respectively. Interestingly, nearly 50% of HCoV infections were detected in association with another virus. Since the distributions of respiratory viruses in multiply infected patients were subject to preferential association patterns between viruses, we propose complex interactions between different respiratory viruses and host factors.
