    abstract = {Recently, a paper was published in which it was proposed that the GxxxG motif of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike (S) protein transmembrane domain plays a vital role in oligomerization of the protein (E. Arbely, Z. Granot, I. Kass, J. Orly, and I. T. Arkin, Biochemistry 45:11349-11356, 2006). Here, we show that the GxxxG motif is not involved in SARS S oligomerization by trimerization analysis of S GxxxG mutant proteins. In addition, the capability of S to mediate entry of SARS S-pseudoryped particles overall was affected moderately in the mutant proteins, also arguing for a nonvital role for the GxxxG motif in SARS coronavirus entry.
