    abstract = {Nine 3-week-old conventional pigs were inoculated intranasally with a Korean isolate of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Three 3-week-old conventional pigs were kept as noninoculated controls. Three inoculated and one control pig were euthanatized at 5, 10, and 15 days postinoculation (DPI), respectively. All nine inoculated pigs developed respiratory disease. Interstitial pneumonia characterized by mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration into alveolar septa were seen microscopically in all nine PRCV-infected pigs. Histopathologic changes were severe at 5 DPI, modest at 10 DPI, and almost resolved at 15 DPI. PRCV antigen was not detected in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium but was detected in interstitial macrophages in the lungs. This Korean isolate of PRCV appeared to replicate primarily within alveolar macrophages in the respiratory system of the pig.},
