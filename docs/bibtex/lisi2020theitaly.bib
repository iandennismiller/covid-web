    abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy is stopping access to elective benign disease treatment and changing the approach to malignant disease as well as the outpatients care of those patients treated for colorectal cancer. The lack of knowledge about the possible implications of the spread of the infection during surgery could extend to infect surgeons, surgery nurses and also the anesthesiologists, the results will become evident in the long term. The surgical approach may change going towards less invasive procedures to minimize the aerosolized biological fluids, this approach could reduce the access to first level hospitals changing the entire health care system in the future.},
