    abstract = {In December of 2019, reports emerged of pneumonia clusters of unknown cause at health facilities in Wuhan, China. These cases were linked to a wet animal wholesale market in the region and, after extensive epidemiologic investigation, led to identification of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 is among a family of viruses-called coronaviruses-that can affect both humans and animals (Zhu et al., 2020).},
