    abstract = {Copyright Â© 2018 American Chemical Society. The research of carbon-based antivirals is still in its infancy, and their development into safe and effective carbon dots (CDs) with antiviral activity at multiple points in the life cycle of the virus remains to be explored. Here, we report a one-step method to apply curcumin in order to prepare of uniform and stable cationic carbon dots (CCM-CDs) with antiviral properties. The inhibitory effect of CCM-CDs on viral replication was studied by using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a coronavirus model. PEDV is applied as a coronavirus model to study the antiviral effect of as-prepared CCM-CDs on its replication. The cationic CCM-CDs treatment is found obviously to inhibit the proliferation of PEDV compared with the common CDs (EDA-CDs). The CCM-CDs treatment can change the structure of surface protein in viruses, thereby inhibiting viral entry. It can also suppresses the synthesis of negative-strand RNA of the virus, the budding of the virus, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species by PEDV. Furthermore, CCM-CDs treatment is also found to suppress viral replication by stimulating the production of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) and proinflammatory cytokines. These results offer theoretical support for the development of CCM-CDs as a hopeful antiviral drug for the treatment of coronavirus infections, including PEDV.},
