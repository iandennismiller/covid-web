    abstract = {A number of different viruses can be primary pathogens in the neonatal calf diarrhea complex. By far the most common viruses causing calfhood diarrhea found throughout the world are rotaviruses and coronaviruses. Primary infection of newborn calves with either one of these viruses can cause severe intestinal alterations and diarrhea. Rotaviruses can produce high-morbidity outbreaks of diarrhea in calves under 10 days of age. Morality is variable mainly owing to secondary bacterial infections and electrolyte imbalances. Rotavirus infection of the small intestinal mucosa leads to loss of enterocytes of the upper third of the intestinal villi with subsequent villous atrophy and malabsorption. There is growing evidence that different rotavirus serotypes of different pathogenicity exist. Coronavirus infections can produce high-morbidity outbreaks of diarrhea in calves under 20 days of age, with variable mortality due to secondary complications. Coronaviruses affect not only the small intestinal mucosa, producing significant villous atrophy, but also the colon, causing a very severe intestinal damage that can lead to death due to subsequent electrolyte disturbances. All coronaviruses associated with neonatal calf diarrhea appear to be of the same serotype. The etiologic diagnosis of viral diarrheas of calves requires the support of the laboratory. One of the most useful diagnostic methods is the examination of fecal extracts for the presence of virus particles by electron microscopy. Other antigen-detection procedures like enzyme immunoassays have been found to be useful in the diagnosis of rotaviral diarrheas. The sample of choice for these diagnostic tests is a fresh fecal sample collected directly from the calf as close as possible to the onset of diarrhea. Samples from more than one calf during the outbreak enhance the laboratory ability to establish a proper viral diagnosis.},
