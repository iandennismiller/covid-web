    abstract = {© 2017, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) exists in types I and II and infects dogs leading mainly to enteritis, though type II has already been associated with generalized and highly lethal infection. A CCoV-type II inactivated vaccine produced in A72 canine cells is available worldwide and largely used, though the molecular stability after serial passages of vaccine seeds is unknown. This article reports the evolution of the CCoV-II vaccine strain 1-71 in A72 cells based on partial S gene sequencing, showing the predominance of neutral evolution and the occurrence of four sites under purifying selection. Thus, cell-adapted strains of CCoV-II may be genetically stable after serial passages in a same cell line due to a stable virus-host relationship.},
