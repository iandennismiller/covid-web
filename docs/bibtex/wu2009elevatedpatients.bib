    abstract = {Pulmonary SP-D is a defence lectin promoting clearance of viral infections. SP-D is recognized to bind the S protein of SARS-CoV and enhance phagocytosis. Moreover, systemic SP-D is widely used as a biomarker of alveolar integrity. We investigated the relation between plasma SP-D, SARS-type pneumonia and the SARS-specific IgG response. Sixteen patients with SARS, 19 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (Streptococcus pneumonia) and 16 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. Plasma SP-D and anti-SARS-CoV N protein IgG were measured using ELISA. SP-D was significantly elevated in SARS-type pneumonia median (95% CI), 453 (379-963) ng/ml versus controls 218 (160-362) ng/ml, P < 0.05 like in patients with CAP. SP-D significantly correlated with anti-SARS-CoV N protein IgG (r2 = 0.5995, P = 0.02). The possible re-emergence of SARS or SARS-like infections suggests a need for minimal traumatic techniques for following the alveolar compartment, e.g. during testing of antivirals. We suggest that monitoring systemic SP-D may be useful in monitoring the alveolar integrity in SARS-type pneumonia. The significant correlation between plasma SP-D and anti-SARS-CoV-specific antibodies support the role for SP-D in interlinking innate and adaptive immune pathways.
