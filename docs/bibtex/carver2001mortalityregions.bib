    abstract = {Poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) is an economically devastating disease. To date, many questions about the syndrome remain unanswered, including its cause, transmission of causative agent(s), and control methods. Turkey coronavirus (TCV) infection has been associated with some outbreaks of PEMS, with areas having a higher prevalence of TCV infection also experiencing an increased incidence of PEMS. This study was designed to establish mortality patterns for flocks experiencing excess mortality and TCV infection in PEMS-affected regions and to delineate the possible role of TCV in PEMS-affected flocks. Fifty-four commercial turkey flocks on farms in areas with and without a history of TCV infection were monitored for weekly mortality and for antibodies to TCV. Flocks were chosen on the basis of placement dates and were monitored from day of placement until processing. All flocks were tested for TCV by an indirect fluorescent antibody assay. PEMS status was determined with the use of the clinical definition of mortality greater than 2% during any 3-wk period from 2 wk of age through the end of brooding due to unknown cause. Of the 54 flocks, 24 remained healthy, 23 experienced PEMS, and 7 tested positive for TCV but did not experience PEMS. Ten flocks experienced PEMS and tested positive for TCV, whereas 13 flocks experienced PEMS and did not test positive for TCV. Four health status groups were evident: healthy, PEMS positive, TCV positive, and PEMS + TCV positive. Distinct mortality patterns were seen for each of the four health status groups. Whereas TCV was associated with PEMS in 43% of PEMS cases, 13 cases (57%) of PEMS did not involve TCV. Additionally, 7 out of 17 cases of TCV (41%) did not experience excess mortality (PEMS) at any time during brooding of the flock. The results of this study indicate that TCV can be associated with PEMS but is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause PEMS.},
