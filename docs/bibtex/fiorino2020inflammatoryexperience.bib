    abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 caused by Coronavirus SARS-CoV2, is rapidly spreading worldwide. This is the first pandemic caused by a Coronavirus in history. More than 150,000 confirmed cases worldwide are reported by the SARS-CoV2, with more than 5,000 COVID-19-related deaths on March 14th, 2020. Fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhoea, confusion, dyspnoea, and bilateral interstitial pneumonia are the common symptoms. No therapies are available, and the only way to contain the virus spread is to regularly and thoroughly clean oneself hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water, to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing, to avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth, and to stay home if one feels unwell. No data are available on the risk of COVID-19 and outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Outbreak restrictions can impact on the IBD care. We aim to give a viewpoint on how operationally manage IBD patients ensuring quality of care in the current pandemic era.},
