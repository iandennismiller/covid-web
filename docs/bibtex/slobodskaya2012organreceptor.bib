    abstract = {Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is the sole known receptor of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59, but the available, often qualitative, data about CEACAM1 expression does not explain MHV organ tropism. Ceacam1 transcripts undergo alternative splicing resulting in multiple isoforms, including secreted CEACAM1 isoforms that can neutralize the virus. We determined the quantities of Ceacam1 transcripts encoding membrane-bound and secreted isoforms in mouse organs and a set of cell lines. In vivo, the lowest receptor mRNA levels were found in brain and muscle and these were similar to those in easily infectable cultured cells. While the quantities of the receptor transcripts varied between mouse organs, their abundance did not correlate with susceptibility to MHV infection. The proportion of transcripts encoding secreted isoforms also could not explain the selection of sites for virus replication, as it was constant in all organs. Our data suggest that neither of the two CEACAM1 isoforms defines MHV organ tropism. Â© 2012 SGM.},
