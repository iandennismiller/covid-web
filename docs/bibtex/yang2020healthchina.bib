    abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the status of health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic in China and to evaluate the regional difference of telehealth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals in China mainland during the COVID-19 epidemic was inquired. The status of non-emergency dental services, emergency dental services, and online professional consultation and the hospitals' geographical distribution were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only. Ninety percent of them notified the change of dental services online, and 69% of them offered free online professional consultations. The penetration rate of online technology was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of the central and western regions. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant change in the health service provision of Chinese public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic and wider use of telehealth in the eastern region. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This report demonstrated that dental health services were significantly affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which might lead to a long-time impact on dental care in the future.},
