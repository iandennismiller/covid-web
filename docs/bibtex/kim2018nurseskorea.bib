Background: This study aimed to identify nurses’ experiences of care for patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Their experiences can be useful to establish a safer healthcare system in preparation for infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews and analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Participants were 12 nurses. Results: Nurses’ experiences of care for patients with MERS-CoV were categorized as follows: “Going into a dangerous field,” “Strong pressure because of MERS-CoV,” “The strength that make me endure,” “Growth as a nurse,” and “Remaining task.” Conclusions: It is necessary to examine the difficulties and demands of healthcare providers for establishing a safe healthcare system to respond effectively when national disasters occur. In addition, it is necessary to develop strategies to protect healthcare providers from severe physical and psychological stress.},
