    abstract = {Â© 2014 Lee and Lee. In April 2014, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in feces from diarrheic piglets in South Korea and found to be closely related to other PDCoV strains. The complete genome of the Korean PDCoV strain, KOR/KNU14-04/2014, was sequenced and analyzed to characterize PDCoV circulating in South Korea.},
