    abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic has caused enormous concern among many people. Every morning, we are met with an increasing deluge of dire news about the most recent number of people to contract COVID-19 and to die from it, decreases in the stock market, and countries implementing broad travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders.(1,2) The current state of affairs is having a negative effect on the mental well-being of our country's residents. It also highlights the policy gaps in our current system that inhibit the vital conditions for well-being and resiliency.(3) Although the primary focus has rightfully been on stopping the spread of COVID-19, we should also quickly prepare to address the mental toll the pandemic is taking on individuals and communities across the country.
