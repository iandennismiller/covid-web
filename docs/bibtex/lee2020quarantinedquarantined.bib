    abstract = {As an emergency medicine physician, I am used to working when most people are not working. At the end of February, the first patient in the U. S. to be diagnosed with COVID-19 without a travel history occurred in Sacramento, CA. Over 120 healthcare professionals who had contact with the patient were quarantined. Beginning of March, I worked in the emergency department and treated a patient with viral symptoms without a travel history who was admitted to the hospital.},
