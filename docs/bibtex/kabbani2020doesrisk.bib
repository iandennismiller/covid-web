    abstract = {COVID19 is a devastating global pandemic with epicenters in China, Italy, Spain, and now the United States. While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage. Infected individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell loss. To that end, less is known about the how the virus may impact different organ systems. The SARS-CoV2 virus, which is responsible for COVID19, is highly similar to SARS-CoV. Both viruses have evolved an ability to enter host cells through direct interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein at the surface of many cells. Published findings indicate that SARS-CoV can enter the human nervous system with evidence from both postmortem brains and detection in cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals. Here we consider the ability of SARS-CoV2 to enter and infect the human nervous system based on the strong expression of the ACE2 target throughout the brain. Moreover, we predict that nicotine exposure through various kinds of smoking (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or vape) can increase the risk for COVID19 neuroinfection based on known functional interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2. We advocate for higher surveillance and analysis of neuro-complications in infected cases.},
