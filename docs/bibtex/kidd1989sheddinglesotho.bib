    abstract = {Stools from 266 children in four districts of Lesotho were examined for viruses by electron microscopy (EM) over a 5‐week period. Eighty one (30.5%) of the children shed coronavirus‐like particles (CVLPs). Shedding was not significantly associated with diarrhea. The proportion of children shedding these particles increased with increasing age. In one district, the prevalence of CVLP shedding (67.9%) was at least twice the prevalence in any of the other three districts. This was the only district to be sampled during the first week of the study. It was shown that the proportion of children shedding CVLPs declined during each of the 5 weeks of study. The stools of six children who shed CVLPs in the early summer of 1984–85 were negative by EM 5 months later. There was no association between the shedding of pathogenic bacteria or parasites and the presence or absence of CVLPs in the stool. Copyright © 1989 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company},
