    abstract = {Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (PHE) is caused by the coronavirus hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHE-CoV), and the recent, rapid spread of PHE-CoV in piglets from many countries emphasizes the urgent need for a PHE-CoV vaccine. Here we use a murine model for evaluation of the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses by inactivated and PHE-CoV DNA vaccines in order to define the immune correlates for protection against PHE-CoV. The inactivated vaccine was composed of purified PHE-CoV and aluminum hydroxide gel (alum), which was chosen as an adjuvant because of its long history of safety for human use. The PHE-CoV DNA vaccine was constructed by subcloning the S1 gene of PHE-CoV into the pVAX1 vector to create the recombinant plasmid pV-S1. Our results showed that the inactivated PHE-CoV vaccine (IPV) elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in good protection efficacy against PHE-CoV challenge. The IPV induced the IgG1 subclass of serum antibodies and expression of the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4), suggesting that the IPV generated a predominantly Th2-type immune response. The DNA vaccine was found to mediate primarily a cellular immune response with high levels of IgG2a and the cytokines IL-2 and gamma interferon (IFN-γ). However, mice that were vaccinated twice with the DNA vaccine and boosted with the IPV could mount a sufficient neutralizing antibody response against live PHE-CoV, with little variation in IgG1 and IgG2a levels, and showed high levels of IL-2 and IL-4. This response may activate both B and T cells to mount a specific humoral and cellular immune response that could, in turn, elicit a phagocyte-mediated defense against PHE-CoV infections to achieve viral clearance.
