    abstract = {In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients need to be evaluated within 2-4 weeks in the following cases: cytology result of "squamous cell carcinoma," "atypical glandular cells, favor neoplastic," "endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ," or "adenocarcinoma"; histopathological diagnosis of suspected invasion from cervical/vaginal biopsy, or invasive disease after a cervical excision procedure, vaginal excision, or vulvar biopsy/excision; sudden onset of strongly suggestive symptoms for malignancy. Digital imaging technologies represent an important opportunity during the COVID-19 pandemic to share colposcopic images with reference centers, with the aim of avoiding any concentration of patients. All patients must undergo screening for COVID-19 exposure and should wear a surgical mask. A high-efficiency filter smoke evacuation system is mandatory to remove surgical smoke. Electrosurgical instruments should be set at the lowest possible power and not be used for long continuous periods to reduce the amount of surgical smoke. The following personal protective equipment should be used: sterile fluid-repellant surgical gloves, an underlying pair of gloves, eye protection, FFP3 mask, surgical cap, and gown. The colposcope should be protected by a disposable transparent cover. A protective lens that must be disinfected after each use should be applied. The use of a video colposcope should be preferred.},
