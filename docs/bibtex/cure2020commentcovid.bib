    abstract = {We read with great interest the article by Cheng H et al. The authors mentioned that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is protective against novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We would like to explain how cytosolic pH increases the COVID-19 infection by affecting the ACE2. In addition, we would like to mention that amiloride, which increases the cytosolic pH, can be used in the COVID-19 treatment. This article is protected by copyright. },
