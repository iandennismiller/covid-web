    abstract = {We report the case of a 3-month-old boy hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. Respiratory distress was associated with cardiogenic shock caused by chaotic atrial tachycardia. The cause of bronchiolitis was a coronavirus NL63 viral infection, confirmed in nasopharyngeal aspirations. The patient required intensive care including diuretics (furosemide), anti-arrhythmic drugs (amiodarone and digoxin), and inotropic drugs (milrinone and levosimendan) associated with mechanical ventilation. The outcome was favorable in 10. days and the sinusal cardiac rhythm was completely restored at discharge. © 2013.},
