    abstract = {A new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading since December 2019. In an attempt to contain the disease, health authorities call for self-quarantine of individuals suspected as exposures. Health officials assume the public will comply in high rates; however, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern over loss of income. A cross sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed depending on compensation for lost wages. The results suggest that when compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94%; yet, when compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57%. This study demonstrates that providing people with assurances for their livelihood during self-quarantine is an important component in compliance with public health regulations.
