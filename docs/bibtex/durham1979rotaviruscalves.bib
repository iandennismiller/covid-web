    abstract = {A virological survey was carried out on 150 calf faeces from 30 central North Island properties, utilising electron miscroscopic examination of ultracentrifuged faecal pellets. Rotaviruses were detected on three farms, and coronavirus-like particles on two farms. In the same area, three other properties with past histories of rotavirus infection were also studied. Weekly examination of faeces from 10 calves from each property over a period of 5 weeks demonstrated that rotavirus excretion commenced at the same time as the onset of outbreaks of diarrhoea. On two of these rotavirus-positive farms, coronaviruses were also detected. At one farm, this coincided with rotavirus excretion and diarrhoea, and was associated with a more severe clinical disease but, on the other property, the coronavirus was unassociated with clinical disease. A similar study, carried out on a further property with a past history of coronavirus infection, showed that coronavirus excretion commenced simultaneously with the onset of an outbreak of diarrhoea. The virus was, however, detected in small numbers in 1 of 10 calves only. The results of the survey, coupled with previously gathered data, indicate that both viruses may be widespread in the cattle population. On some properties, rotavirus had a clear association with diarrhoea, but the relationship of coronavirus to diarrhoea was less well-established. Â© 1979, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},
