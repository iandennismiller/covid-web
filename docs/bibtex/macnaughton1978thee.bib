    abstract = {The genomic RNA of human coronavirus strain 229E (HCV 229E) migrated on polyacrylamide gels as a single peak with a mol. wt. of 5.8 x 106. Denaturation of the genome with formaldehyde did not alter its electrophoretic mobility, which suggests that the HCV 229E genome is a single-stranded molecule. At least 30% of the genomic RNA was shown to contain covalently attached polyadenylic acid [poly(A)] sequences by binding the RNA to an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. These poly(A) tracts were shown to be about 70 nucleotides in length by measuring the resistance to digestion of HCV 229E RNA with pancreatic and T1RNases. Finally, the genomic RNA was shown to terminate at or near the 3'-terminus on the basis of its susceptibility to polynucleotide phosphorylase.},
