    abstract = {Novel coronavirus has become a global health hazard and its high infectivity is alarming. The imaging findings of the 2019-nCoV infection in our young diabetic patient featured ground-glass opacities and consolidations in both lungs. The lung lesions may involute rapidly during the course. The patient showed improvement both clinically and on computed tomography imaging at discharged after 2 weeks'treatment. Computed tomography scans of patients helped monitor the changes continuously, which could timely provide the information of the evolution of the disease or therapeutic effect to clinicians.},
