    abstract = {Four murine coronavirus antigens, sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) strain TG, Parker's rat coronavirus (PCV) strain 8190, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains S and NuU, were examined for their reactivities to hyperimmunized and naturally infected rat sera by ELISA. With the immunized sera, SDAV and PCV antigens reacted best with respective homologous sera. MHV antigens reacted with all antisera, anti-SDAV, anti-PCV, and anti-MHV-S at approximately the same level, and MHV-S showed a slightly higher reactivity than MHV-NuU. The reactivities of the sera from various colonies to these antigens were in the order--from high to low--of SDAV, MHV-S, MHV-NuU, and PCV. None of sera negative for SDAV antigen reacted positively to the other antigens. Within the sera positive for SDAV, the positivities were in the order of MHV-S, MHV-NuU, and PCV. These results suggested that, although homologous antigens are best to detect SDAV or PCV infection by ELISA, MHV antigen can be used if highly cross-reactive viral strain is selected.},
