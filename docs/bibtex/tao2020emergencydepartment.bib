    abstract = {As of Feb 15, 2020, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China and across the world with more than 60,000 laboratory-confirmed cases. Due to the current lack of specific treatment and the risk of transmission during the viral incubation period, infection prevention and control of 2019-nCoV are both urgent and critical to global health. In this article, we aim to highlight the necessity of implementing protective measures, and recommend how to set proper emergency management plans for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019-nCoV in dermatology departments.},
