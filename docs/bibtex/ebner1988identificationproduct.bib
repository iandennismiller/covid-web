    abstract = {A bacterial expression vector was constructed to encode a fusion protein which had, at its carboxy terminus, a polypeptide encoded within the 5' proximal open reading frame of the coronavirus MHV-JHM mRNA 4. This polypeptide was isolated and used to produce an antiserum. The antiserum reacted specifically with a 15000 M(r) polypeptide synthesized in MHV-JHM-infected cells, or in vitro translations of infected cell poly(A) RNA enriched for mRNA 4. These results demonstrate the translational activity of mRNA 4 during infection, identify conclusively the translation product and provide a means to investigate the synthesis and function of this protein.},
