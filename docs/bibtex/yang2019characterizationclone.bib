    abstract = {Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc. Swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), also known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), belongs to the species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2. Herein, we report on the primary characterization of SeACoV in vitro. Four antibodies against the SeACoV spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and nonstructural protein 3 capable of reacting with viral antigens in SeACoV-infected Vero cells were generated. We established a DNA-launched SeACoV infectious clone based on the cell adapted passage-10 virus and rescued the recombinant virus with a unique genetic marker in cultured cells. Six subgenomic mRNAs containing the leader-body junction sites, including a bicistronic mRNA encoding the accessory NS7a and NS7b genes, were experimentally identified in SeACoV-infected cells. Cellular ultrastructural changes induced by SeACoV infection were visualized by electron microscopy. The availability of the SeACoV infectious clone and a panel of antibodies against different viral proteins will facilitate further studies on understanding the molecular mechanisms of SeACoV replication and pathogenesis.},
