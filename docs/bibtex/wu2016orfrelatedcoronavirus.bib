    abstract = {Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Several lineage B betacoronaviruses termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like Co. Vs (SL-Co. Vs) were identified from Rhinolophus bats in China. These viruses are characterized by a set of unique accessory open reading frames (ORFs) that are located between the M and N genes. Among unique accessory ORFs, ORF8 is most hypervariable. In this study, the ORF8s of all SL-Co. Vs were classified into 3 types, and, for the first time, it was found that very few SL-Co. Vs from Rhinolophus sinicus have ORF8s that are identical to that of human SARS-CoV. This finding provides new genetic evidence for Chinese horseshoe bats as the source of human SARS-CoV.},
