    abstract = {Sera from patients with multiple sclerosis and carefully matched controls were tested for antibodies to three strains of coronavirus. There was no significant difference in the levels of antibody in the patients vs the controls. We conclude that unless the strains of coronaviruses recently reported to have been isolated from patients with multiple sclerosis express important serological differences from those used in these studies, coronaviruses are not associated with the cause of multiple sclerosis.
