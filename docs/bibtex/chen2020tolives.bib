    abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thus far caused a total of 81,747 confirmed cases with 3,283 deaths in China, and more than 370,000 confirmed cases including over 16,000 deaths around the world by March 24, 2020. This issue has received extensive attention from the international community and has become a major public health priority. As the pandemic progresses, it is regrettable to know the healthcare workers, including anesthesiologists, being infected constantly. Therefore, we would like to share our firsthand practical experience and perspective in China, focusing on the personal protection of healthcare workers and the risk factors related to their infection, based on the different stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China.},
