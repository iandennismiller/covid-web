    abstract = {Neonatal calf diarrhea is a significant health problem in dairy industry in the whole world. Although the aetiological agents of neonatal diarrhea are diverse, it is obvious that viruses play an important role. One of them is bovine conoravirus (BCV). Since BCV was discovered (Mebus et al., 1969), there have been many published reports describing the virus and its importance in calves. In China, we first investigated the seroepidemiological status of BCV infections in cattle (Yao et al., 1990). The results showed that the incidence of infections with BCV in cattle in different chinese regions are high. Further work on direct diagnosis of BCV as a causative agent of diarrhea was therefore necessary. In the last years we have developed diagnostic methods including a monoclonal antibody‐based ELISA to detect BCV and other diarrheal viruses. In this study, the diagnosis of an outbreak of BCV in chinese dairy cattle is described. © 1991 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},
