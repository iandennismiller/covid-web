    abstract = {The outbreak of a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) in China in December 2019 has brought serious challenges to disease prevention and public health. Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who undergo cardiovascular surgery necessitate extremely high demands from anesthesia personnel, and face high risks of mortality and morbidity. Based on the current understanding of COVID-19 and the clinical characteristics of cardiovascular surgical patients, the authors provide anesthesia management guidelines for cardiovascular surgery along with the prevention and control of COVID-19.},
