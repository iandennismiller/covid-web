    abstract = {In response to the recent novel coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, observations concerning novel coronavirus mortality are of urgent public health importance. The present work presents the first review of the fatal novel coronavirus cases in China. Clinical data of fatal cases published by the Chinese Government were studied. As of 2 February 2020, the clinical data of 46 fatal cases were identified. The case fatality rate was significantly higher in Hubei province than the rest of China. While 67% of all deceased patients were male, gender was unlikely to be associated with mortality. Diabetes was likely to be associated with mortality. There is, however, not yet sufficient evidence to support the association between hypertension and mortality as similar prevalence of hypertension was also observed in the Hubei population.},
