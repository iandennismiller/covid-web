    abstract = {RNA chaperones are nonspecific nucleic acid binding proteins with long disordered regions that help RNA molecules to adopt its functional conformation. Coronavirus nucleoproteins (N) are nonspecific RNA-binding proteins with long disordered regions. Therefore, we investigated whether transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) N protein was an RNA chaperone. Purified N protein enhanced hammerhead ribozyme self-cleavage and nucleic acids annealing, which are properties that define RNA chaperones. In contrast, another RNA-binding protein, PTB, did not show these activities. N protein chaperone activity was blocked by specific monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, it was concluded that TGEV N protein is an RNA chaperone. In addition, we have shown that purified severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV N protein also has RNA chaperone activity. In silico predictions of disordered domains showed a similar pattern for all coronavirus N proteins evaluated. Altogether, these data led us to suggest that all coronavirus N proteins might be RNA chaperones. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. },
