    abstract = {Two human coronaviruses, strains OC38 and OC43, were successfully adapted to growth in tissue culture monolayers. The adapted strains produced a cytopathic effect in primary rhesus or vervet monkey kidney and in BSC-1 cell monolayers. The adaptation described will facilitate further investigations of the structure of coronaviruses. },
