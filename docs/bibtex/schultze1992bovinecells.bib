    abstract = {The importance of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) as a receptor determinant for bovine coronavirus (BCV) on cultured cells was analysed. Pretreatment of MDCK I (Madin Darby canine kidney) cells with neuraminidase or acetylesterase rendered the cells resistant to infection by BCV. The receptors on a human (Ca. Co-2) and a porcine (LLC-PK1) epithelia cell line were also found to be sensitive to neuraminidase treatment. The susceptibility to infection by BCV was restored after resialylation of asialo-MDCK I cells with Neu5, 9Ac2. Transfer of sialic acid lacking a 9-O-acetyl group was ineffective in this respect. These results demonstrate that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is used as a receptor determinant by BCV to infect cultured cells. The possibility is discussed that the initiation of a BCV infection involves the recognition of different types of receptors, a first receptor for primary attachment and a second receptor to mediate the fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane.},
