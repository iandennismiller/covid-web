    abstract = {Coronavirus disease is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus that is moving rapidly. High resolution computed tomography (CT) allows objective evaluation of the lung lesions, thus enabling us to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease. With serial CT examinations, the occurrence, development, and prognosis of the disease can be better understood. The imaging can be sorted into four phases: early phase, progressive phase, severe phase, and dissipative phase. The CT appearance of each phase and temporal progression of the imaging findings are demonstrated.},
