In addition, we put forward the contents and countermeasures for the modernization of the disease prevention and control system. The modernization of the disease prevention and control system should be built around governance modernization, talent modernization, equipment modernization, scientific research modernization, and modernization of the regulatory system. The countermeasures and suggestions need to reposition the disease prevention and control system, rationalize the management system and operating mechanism, strengthen the modernization of talents and equipment, strengthen scientific research on disease prevention and control, and further improve the disease prevention and control legal system.},
