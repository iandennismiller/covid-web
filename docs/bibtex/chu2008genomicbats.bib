    abstract = {We previously reported the detection of bat coronaviruses (bat Co. Vs 1A, 1B. HKU7. HKU8 and bat-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in Miniopterus,spp. that cohabit a cave in Hong Kong. Here, we report the full genomic s equences of bat Co. Vs 1A, 1B and HKU8. Bat Co. Vs 1A and 1B, which are commonly found in the Miniopterus, are phylogenetically closely related. Using species-specific RT-PCR assays, bat Co. Vs 1A and 1B were confirmed to have distinct host specificities to Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus, respectively. Interestingly, co-infections of bat Co. Vs 1B and HKU8 in M. pusillus are detected in seven of 38 virus-positive specimens collected from 2004 to 2006. These findings highlight that co-infections of some coronaviruses might be common events in nature. The biological basis for the host restriction of bat coronaviruses, however, is yet to be determined. Â© 2008 SGM.},
