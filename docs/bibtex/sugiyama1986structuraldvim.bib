    abstract = {The structural polypeptides of the murine coronavirus DVIM (diarrhoea virus of infant mice) have been analysed in comparison with other strains MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-4 (JHM) and MHV-S by SDS-PAGE. In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, three major glycopolypeptides, gp180, gp69, gp25 (as a group of similar species) and one major non-glycosylated polypeptide p58 were detected. The gp69 is a DVIM specific glycopolypeptide, in which the glycosidic moieties are linked to the core polypeptide through N-glycosidic bonds, and hence may be correlated with the short projections of the viral envelope. Further gp140, which appears in the absence of reducing agents, is apparently a dimer of gp69 held together by disulfide linkages. The gp25 family, on the other hand, consists of four polypeptides, two of which are not metabolically inhibited by tunicamycin suggesting that they are O-linked glycopolypeptides. DVIM seems to be serologically closely related to the MHV-S strain as shown by neutralization. },
