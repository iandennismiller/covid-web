    abstract = {Objective: To understand the incidence trend and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province. Methods: The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. Results: A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi. Most cases were mild (87.76%). As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase. The case number in Xi'an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province. The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission. The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi. After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. Conclusions: At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated. However, considering the approaching of return to work and study and the increasing of imported cases from other countries, the prevention and control of COVIS-19 in Shaanxi will face new challenges.},
