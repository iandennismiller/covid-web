Avian coronavirus is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens, leading to multisystemic disease that might be controlled if adequate vaccine strains are used. This paper reports the first complete genome sequence of a Brazil type of this virus (27,615 nucleotides [nt]) isolated from the kidneys of a chicken.},
