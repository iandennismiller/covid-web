    abstract = {In infected embryonic mule skin cells, Berne virus directs the synthesis of two main polypeptides (22K, 20K); in addition, virus-specific proteins with apparent molecular weights of >200K, 80K to 120K, 32K and 17K were detected after radioimmune precipitation. The replication of Berne virus was reduced more than 1000-fold by actinomycin D, when the drug (0.1 to 1.0 μg/ml) was added during the first 8 h after infection; alpha-amanitin (25 μg/ml) produced a similar though less pronounced effect. U.v. preirradiation of the cells for ≥5s led to a dramatic decrease in the production of extracellular virus. The results presented support our suggestion that Berne virus is a representative of a new family of animal viruses.},
