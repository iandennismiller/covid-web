    abstract = {Examination of crude mouse brain harvest of coronavirus strain OC 43 by ultracentrifugation, sucrose density gradients, immunodiffusion, and immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated that the antigens active in the conventional CF and HA tests were associated with the virion. No soluble antigenic components were detected. Purification of the virus was achieved by adsorption and elution from human “O” erythrocytes followed by batch calcium phosphate chromatography. Studies with the purified virus confirmed our findings with the crude mouse brain harvest. Treatment of crude and purified antigen with a limited number of disrupting substances failed to yield soluble CF or HA subunits, but a systematic investigation of other techniques for releasing viral subunits is now made possible through the simple purification procedures described in this report. },
