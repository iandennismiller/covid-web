    abstract = {The 2019-novel coronavirus predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from upper respiratory symptoms to full blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment. Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation are essential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases. Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus. Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia. At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol. We, herein, provide guidance on non-invasive respiratory support, intubation and management of ARDS in a child with COVID-19.},
