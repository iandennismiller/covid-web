    abstract = {The role of human enteric coronaviruses in infantile gastroenteritis is controversial. We detected coronavirus-like particles in the intestinal contents and within the epithelial cells of the ileum in a 15-month-old infant who had postmortem evidence of severe enteritis. Ultrastructural findings consistent with in vivo coronavirus replication in the human small intestine support a causative role for this agent in gastroenteritis.
