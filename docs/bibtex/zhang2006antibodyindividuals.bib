    abstract = {Most of the SARS-CoV-infected patients spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention while a small percentage succumbed to the disease. Here, we characterized temporal changes in N protein-specific and S glycoprotein-specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in infected patients who have either recovered from or succumbed to SARS-CoV infection. Recovered patients were found to have higher and sustainable levels of both N protein-specific and S glycoprotein-specific Nab responses, suggesting that antibody responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS-CoV-infected patients.
