    abstract = {The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, changed the world within a matter of weeks. The primary action to constrain the spread of the virus is social isolation. Given this public health principle, and the shortage of personal protective equipment during the global pandemic, all health care stakeholders need to reconsider the indications for face-to-face health care encounters in providing patient care.
