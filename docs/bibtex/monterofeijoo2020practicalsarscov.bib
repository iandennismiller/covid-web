    abstract = {In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health and health Commission (Hubei Province, China) reported a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology. On January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified as a causative agent of the outbreak a new type of virus of the Coronaviridiae family, called SARS-CoV-2. Since then, thounsands of cases have been reported with global dissemination. Infections in humans cause a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection, to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. There is not specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2, which is why the fundamental aspects are to establish adequate prevention measures and support treatment and management of complications.},
