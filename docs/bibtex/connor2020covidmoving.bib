As the need to appropriately direct all efforts towards providing emergency supportive care to those suffering, there will be a knee-jerk tendency to cancel all outpatient activity by NHS trusts. Whilst this appears to be a pragmatic approach to reducing risk of transmission, there will be an unmet cost to those patients who are high-risk and are already on the cancer referral pathway.},
