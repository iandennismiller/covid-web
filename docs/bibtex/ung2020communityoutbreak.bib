Community pharmacists in one of the first areas that had confirmed cases of the viral infection, Macau, joined the collaborative force in supporting the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. This paper aimed to improve the understanding of community pharmacists' role in case of 2019-CoV outbreak based on the practical experiences in consultation with the recommendations made by the International Pharmaceutical Federation on the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak.},
