    abstract = {The sequence of the gene encoding the membrane protein of human coronavirus 229 E (HCV 229 E) has been determined. The primary translation product, deduced from the DNA sequence, is a polypeptide of 225 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 26,000. The polypeptide has 3 potential N-glycosylation sites. Many structural similarities with the membrane proteins of other coronaviruses can be recognized. },
