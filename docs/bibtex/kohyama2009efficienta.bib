    abstract = {Spike and nucleocapsid are structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and major targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In contrast, non-structural proteins encoded by two-thirds of viral genome are poorly characterized for cell-mediated immunity. We previously demonstrated that nucleocapsid-derived peptides chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes effectively elicited SARS-CoV-specific CTLs in mice. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes derived from a non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV, and investigated whether liposomal peptides derived from pp1a were effective for CTL induction. Out of 30 peptides predicted on computational algorithms, nine peptides could significantly induce interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing CD8+ T cells in mice. These peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes, and inoculated into mice. Six liposomal peptides effectively induced IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells and seven liposomal peptides including the six peptides primed CTLs showing in vivo killing activities. Further, CTLs induced by the seven liposomal peptides lysed an HLA-A*0201 positive cell line expressing naturally processed, pp1a-derived peptides. Of note, one of the liposomal peptides induced high numbers of long-lasting memory CTLs. These data suggest that surface-linked liposomal peptides derived from pp1a might offer an efficient CTL-based vaccine against SARS. },
