    abstract = {The polypeptide profile of the cell-adapted strain of bovine coronavirus (Mebus BCV-L9) is remarkably affected by the host cell and trypsin. We compared the structural proteins of virus purified from different cell lines and found cell-dependent differences in the virus structure. BCV was purified from four clones of human rectal tumour cells (HRT-18): 3 F3, D 2, 3 E 3, and 4 B 3. The structural profiles of BCV propagated in clones 3 E 3 and 3 F 3 were identical, consisting of proteins with molecular weights of 185, 160, 140, 125, 110, 100, 52, 46, 37, 31-34, and 26-28 kilodaltons (kd). BCV purified from clone D2 lacked the 100 kd species, and clone 4 B 3 yielded virus lacking the 46 kd protein. We compared the structures of BCV propagated in HRT-18 cells [BCV(HRT-18)] and virus raised in bovine fetal spleen cells [BCV(D 2 BFS)]. The concentration of the 185 kd protein was higher in BCV (D 2BFS), and it also contained a 200 kd species. Protein profiles of in vitro trypsin treated and untreated BCV(HRT-18) differed only under reducing conditions, suggesting that trypsin cleavage sites are located within disulfide-linked regions of affected proteins. Propagation of BCV in D 2 BFS cells in the presence of trypsin resulted in cleavage of the 185 kd protein and a concommitant increase of the 100 kd protein. Activation of the fusion function probably depends on this cleavage process because fusion of BCV-infected D 2 BFS cells is trypsin dependent. },
