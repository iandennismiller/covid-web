    abstract = {A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1], and after a few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a global pandemic [2]. Scientifically, the virus was named "severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2) coronavirus" [3]. High-level endemic transmissions occurred in several countries, and while yet very limited, have spread in certain regions of the globe, particularly in Africa [4].
