    abstract = {We read with great interest a recent editorial by Liang et al. on the management of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Their recommendations are clinically oriented and are likely to be useful to obstetricians and other healthcare professionals caring for such patients. However, we feel that development of evidence-based guidelines has been hindered by selective reporting of cases. We hereby would like to discuss a few additional points with regards to the challenges encountered while managing pregnant patients with COVID-19.},
