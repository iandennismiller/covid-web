    abstract = {Transmissible proventriculitis associated with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was at first seen in eastern China in mid-1995, and is now endemic in China. Herein, the complete genome sequence of a proventiculitis-associated infectious bronchitis coronavirus (ZJ971) was sequenced and analyzed. Compared with the genome of the vaccine strain H120, ZJ971 had 54 nucleotide substitutions and a deletion in the 3′-UTR. The substitutions were in the regions of nsp2-nsp5, nsp7, nsp12, nsp13, nsp15, S and N genes, and the untranslating region. The results indicated that ZJ971 could be a variant of IBV strain H120. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},
