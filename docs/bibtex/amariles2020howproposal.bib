    abstract = {Colombia confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 on March 6th, 2020. On March 16th, 2020, 54 cases have been confirmed (36 imported and 18 associated), therefore, Colombia is at highest alert, and it is now trying to avoid or minimize the last stage of "community transmission". We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process. Community pharmacies and pharmacy staff play a crucial role in minimizing the stage of "community transmission" of COVID-19, through properly detection and management of possible cases and customer education.},
