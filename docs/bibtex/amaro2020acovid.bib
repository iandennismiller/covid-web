    abstract = {There is an urgent need to share our methods, models, and results openly and quickly to test findings, ensure reproducibility, test significance, eliminate dead-ends, and accelerate discovery. Sharing of data for COVID-19 applications will help connect scientists across the global biomolecular simulation community, and also improve connection and communication between simulation and experimental and clinical data and investigators. We, as a community, commit to the following principles and offer our support to others already working on open data efforts in the hope that others working on COVID-19 in biomolecular simulation and other areas will adopt similar best practices.},
