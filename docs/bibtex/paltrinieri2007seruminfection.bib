    abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that the concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) transiently increases in asymptomatic cats infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV). In order to establish whether these fluctuations depend on the FCoV status, the serum concentration of AGP and anti-FCoV antibody titres and/or faecal shedding of FCo. Vs in clinically healthy cats from catteries with different levels of prevalence of FCoV infection were monitored over time. Serum AGP concentrations fluctuated over time in clinically healthy cats from the cattery with the highest prevalence of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and significantly increased just before an outbreak of FIP. Further studies are required to clarify whether the observed increase of AGP concentration is a consequence of the increased viral burden or a protective response against mutated viral strains. Nevertheless, the results of the present study suggest that AGP might be useful in monitoring FCoV-host interactions in FCoV-endemic catteries. © 2007 ESFM and AAFP.},
