    abstract = {Four cytopathogenic viruses were isolated in CPK cells derived from porcine kidneys from tonsils and lungs of 3 of 15 pigs affected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Physicochemically and morphologically, the isolates were similar to a coronavirus. The isolates were not distinguished from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by a neutralization test using polyclonal antibodies, but differentiated from TGEV by monoclonal antibodies capable of discriminating between TGEV and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), indicating that the isolates were PRCV. In a serological survey of 30 serum samples each collected from about 50 days old pigs in the 2 affected farms, 29 (97%) and 15 (50%) sera were positive for neutralizing antibody against the isolate with the titers ranging from 2 to 64, respectively.},
