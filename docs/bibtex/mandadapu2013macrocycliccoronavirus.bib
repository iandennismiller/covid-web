    abstract = {The design, synthesis, and in vitro evaluation of the first macrocyclic inhibitor of 3C and 3C-like proteases of picornavirus, norovirus, and coronavirus are reported. The in vitro inhibitory activity (50% effective concentration) of the macrocyclic inhibitor toward enterovirus 3C protease (CVB3 Nancy strain), and coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and norovirus 3C-like proteases, was determined to be 1.8, 15.5 and 5.1 μM, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. },
