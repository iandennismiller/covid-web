    abstract = {A trasmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus mutant (188-SG), selected as attenuated and resistant to acidity and proteases of the digestive tract of adult pigs, was used as vaccine ("Nouzilly strain") in sows to protect suckling piglets against a challenge exposure carried out with a higly virulent TGEV strain. The pregnant sows were immunized once (42-49 days before farrowing) or twice (42-49 and 7-15 days before farrowing) by the oral, intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-SG strain. Sows exposed to virulent TGEV in the field and experimentally infected sows (two oral inoculations during pregnancy) were used as positive controls leading to high protection. The neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk. No protection against mortality was observed in the litters of (1) the nine seronegative, susceptible sows, with piglet mortality of 65/70, (2) the seven once orally vaccinated sows, with mortality of 44/54, (3) the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route, with mortality of 55/76. Moderate protection was observed in (1) the eight sows vaccinated intramuscularly twice with piglet mortality of 36/90, (2) the seven orally and intramuscularly vaccinated sows with piglet mortality of 31/51. In contrast, improved protection was observed in (1) the 10 sows vaccinated twice orally, with piglet mortality of 23/95, (2) the four naturally infected sows with piglet mortality of 6/41, (3) the six sows experimentally infected with virulent TGEV with piglet mortality of 1/59. No correlation was found between neutralizing antibodies titers in serum and milk and protection rate of the piglets. The results indicate that relative protective lactogenic immunity against TGEV is induced only by repeated ingestion of -SG attenuated 188-SG strain of TGEV. Â© 1991.},
