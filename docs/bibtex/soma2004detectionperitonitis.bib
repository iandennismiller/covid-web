    abstract = {To investigate the usefulness of ascites as a material for viral tests in cats with effusive feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), we attempted to detect anti-feline coronavirus antibody, anti-feline immunodeficiency virus antibody, and feline leukemia virus antigen in ascites from 88 cats clinically suspected with effusive FIP. In each of these three viral tests, all cats positive for serum antibody/antigen were also positive for ascitic antibody/antigen, while cats negative for serum antibody/antigen were also negative for ascitic antibody/antigen. This finding indicates that ascites is useful for these viral tests.},
