    abstract = {A case of an enteric coronavirus infection in a 6-week-old dromedary calf is described. The animal had diarrhea for 5 days and died despite symptomatic treatment. Numerous viral particles, approximately 140 nm in diameter, with club-like projections were detected in the feces by electron microscopy. These characteristics were consistent with a coronavirus. Immunohistochemical reactivity with 2 antigenic group II coronavirus-specific antibodies confirmed the presence of viral antigen in colonie epithelial cells. The death of the animal was attributed to a neutrophilic and emphysematous colitis that likely was caused by an infection with a Clostridium sp.},
