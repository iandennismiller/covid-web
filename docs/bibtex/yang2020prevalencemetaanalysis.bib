    abstract = {BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) in Wuhan, China, the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. AIMS: The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases Pub. Med, EMBASE, and Web of sciences until February 25, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 46248 infected patients. The result showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91 +/- 3, 95% CI 86-97% ), followed by cough (67 +/- 7, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue ( 51 +/- 0, 95% CI 34-68% ) and dyspnea ( 30 +/- 4, 95% CI 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension (17 +/- 7, 95% CI 14-22%) and diabetes ( 8 +/- 6, 95% CI 6-11% ), followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5 +/- 4, 95% CI 4-7% ) and respiratory system disease( 2 +/- 0, 95% CI 1-3% ). Compared with the Non-severe patient, the pooled odds ratio of hypertension, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease in severe patients were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46-3.83), (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22)respectively. CONCLUSION: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and found underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular, may be a risk factor for severe patients compared with Non-severe patients.},
