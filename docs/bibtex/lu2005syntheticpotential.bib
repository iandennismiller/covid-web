    abstract = {The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important viral structural protein. Based on bioinformatics analysis, 10 antigenic peptides derived from the S protein sequence were selected and synthesized. The antigenicity and immunoreactivity of all the peptides were tested in vivo and in vitro. Four peptides (P6, P8, P9 and P10) which contain B cell epitopes of the S protein were identified, and P8 peptide was confirmed in vivo to have a potential in serological diagnosis. By using a syncytia formation model, we tested the neutralization ability of all 10 peptides and their corresponding antibodies. It is interesting to find that P8 and P9 peptides inhibited syncytia formation, suggesting that the P8 and P9 spanning regions may provide a good target for anti-SARS-CoV drug design. Our data suggest that we have identified peptides derived from the S protein of SARS-CoV, which are useful for SARS treatment and diagnosis. Â© 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.
