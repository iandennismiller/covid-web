    abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiologic features of an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tianjin caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and to provide scientific basis for prevention and control measures. METHODS: Data from COVID-19 cases were collected from daily notifications given to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Tianjin Health Committee. All of the data were analyzed with SPSS version 24.0 software. RESULTS: As of February 24, 2020, there have been 135 confirmed cases, 3 deaths, and 87 recoveries in Tianjin, China. The incidence of COVID-19 was 8.65/1,000,000 with a 2.22% case fatality rate. Regarding geographic distribution, the incidence was 8.82 per 1,000,000 in urban areas and 8.00 per 1,000,000 in suburbs. During the early stage of the epidemic, most cases came from urban areas and in patients with a history of sojourning in Hubei Province. The majority of patients were 31-70 years old (75.97%). A familial cluster was the most important characteristic of COVID-19 (accounting for 74.81%). CONCLUSIONS: Current information suggests that people are generally susceptible to COVID-19, which has shown a familial cluster in Tianjin.},
