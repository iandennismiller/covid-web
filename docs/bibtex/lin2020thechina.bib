    abstract = {In December 2019, COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbroke in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China. The disease rapidly spread to other areas in China due to a huge population movement during the New Year Festival. Here, a 7-year-old child with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Chongqing, outside of Wuhan, Hubei province, was reported. This case suggested that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to present milder manifestations than adults. The continuous positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the child's throat swab sample indicated the isolation period for suspected child cases should be longer than 14 days.},
