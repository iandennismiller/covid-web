    abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has already affected many thousands of people and has become the greatest health challenge worldwide [1]. The range of clinical presentations varies from asymptomatic and mild clinical symptoms to acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Due to the unknown number of asymptomatic viral-shedding and pauci-symptomatic people in the community, the total number of infections is uncertain. As yet, effective treatment is unavailable. However, the results of preliminary studies and clinical trials are improving our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Covid-19. Herein, we share our personal opinions on the immunopathogenesis of this infection.},
