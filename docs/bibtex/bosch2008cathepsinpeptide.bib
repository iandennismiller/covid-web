    abstract = {Unlike other class I viral fusion proteins, spike proteins on severe acute respiratory sydrome coronavirus virions are uncleaved. As we and others have demonstrated, infection by this virus depends on cathepsin proteases present in endosomal compartments of the target cell, suggesting that the spike protein acquires its fusion competence by cleavage during cell entry rather than during virion biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that cathepsin L indeed activates the membrane fusion function of the spike protein. Moreover, cleavage was mapped to the same region where, in coronaviruses carrying furin-activated spikes, the receptor binding subunit of the protein is separated from the membrane-anchored fusion subunit.
