    abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, in particular in the Milan focal point, required drastic measures and led to panic in the population. While in our centre we did not change our approach to the treatment of our young cancer patients, we developed a qualitative survey to assess their perception of the risk and level of stress. The survey showed that a relatively large proportion of them felt personally at risk of severe complications. We believe that we need to adequately inform our patients, focusing on hygienic measures and personal protection and prompt reporting of any suspicious symptoms.
