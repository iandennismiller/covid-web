    abstract = {The entry and dissemination of viruses in several families can be mediated by C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN. We showed that entry of the serotype II feline coronavirus strains feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) WSU 79-1146 and DF2 into nonpermissive mouse 3T3 cells can be rescued by the expression of human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN) and that infection of a permissive feline cell line (Crandall-Reese feline kidney) was markedly enhanced by the overexpression of hDC-SIGN. Treatment with mannan considerably reduced infection of feline monocyte-derived cells expressing DC-SIGN, indicating a role for FIPV infection in vivo.
