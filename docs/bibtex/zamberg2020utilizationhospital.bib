    abstract = {BACKGROUND: As part of response plans for current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, authorities are drafting and implementing containment measures across jurisdictions worldwide in the effort to slow transmission and infection rate. A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mHealth platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about the SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures as well as FAQ for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile application developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnostic of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: During the period of February 25 to March 13, 2020 (18 days) information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times which amounted for 35.6% of total content views. User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD = 14.4) vs 26.4 (SD = 9.8) users per day comparing to previous weeks (p < 0.001). In addition, sessions number per day more than doubled during mentioned period (p < 0.001). In a survey medical staff found the information easy to find within the application. On a 10 point Likert-scale the ability of the application to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated 7.6 (SD = 2.1), time-saving ability was rated 8.5/10 (SD = 2.1) and the need to look for information from other sources was rated with a score of 5.9/10 (SD = 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus related information seemed to be an effective and timesaving communication channel within our institution during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice. More research should be done concerning the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.},
