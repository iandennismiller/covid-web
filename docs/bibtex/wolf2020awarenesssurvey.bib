    abstract = {Background: The evolving outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is requiring social distancing and other measures to protect public health. However, messaging has been inconsistent and unclear. Objective: To determine COVID-19 awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and related behaviors among U. S. adults who are more vulnerable to complications of infection because of age and comorbid conditions. Design: Cross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 1 cohort study. Setting: 5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers. Patients: 630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1 or more chronic conditions. Measurements: Self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Results: A fourth (24.6%) of participants were "very worried" about getting the coronavirus. Nearly a third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%). One in 4 adults (24.6%) believed that they were "not at all likely" to get the virus, and 21.9% reported that COVID-19 had little or no effect on their daily routine. One in 10 respondents was very confident that the federal government could prevent a nationwide outbreak. In multivariable analyses, participants who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were more likely to be less worried about COVID-19, to not believe that they would become infected, and to feel less prepared for an outbreak. Those with low health literacy had greater confidence in the federal government response. Limitation: Cross-sectional study of adults with underlying health conditions in 1 city during the initial week of the COVID-19 U. S. outbreak. Conclusion: Many adults with comorbid conditions lacked critical knowledge about COVID-19 and, despite concern, were not changing routines or plans. Noted disparities suggest that greater public health efforts may be needed to mobilize the most vulnerable communities. Primary Funding Source: National Institutes of Health.},
