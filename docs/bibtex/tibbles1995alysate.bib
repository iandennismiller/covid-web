    abstract = {In order to investigate the mechanisms involved in the processing of infectious bronchitis virus polyproteins, several candidate regions of the genome have been cloned and expressed in vitro. During these studies it was observed that the translation product encoded by one of these clones (pKT205) was poorly expressed. Biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that the basis for the poor expression was a post-translational event involving ubiquitination of the protein and degradation by an ATP-dependent system operating in the reticulocyte lysate used for the in vitro expression. Two independently acting regions which conferred instability were identified, one of which mapped to the predicted 3C protease domain, contained within the 5' end of the clone, while the other, more C-terminal region, was effective in conferring instability upon a heterologous protein to which it had been transferred. These regions may influence the stability of the authentic viral protein(s) in vivo and hence allow for the control of their expression and/or function at the level of proteolysis by cellular protease(s).},
