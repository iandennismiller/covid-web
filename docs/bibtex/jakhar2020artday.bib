    abstract = {Dermatoscope is a convenient diagnostic tool used by dermatologists in the diagnosis of skin, hair and nail disorders. During dermoscopy, a dermatoscope comes in contact with the patient and hence can act as a potential source of nosocomial spread of infections.(1) The uncertainty associated with the mode of spread of current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has only lead to confusion and studies are underway to determine the role of zoonotic and environmental factors.(2-4) There are reports of presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on door handles, mobile phones and other surfaces.},
