    abstract = {From a large medical center in Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we report clinical features and prognosis for three women diagnosed with COVID-19 after gynecologic oncology surgery and hospitalized in January 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 was 0.77% (3 of 389) of total hospitalizations and 1.59% (3 of 189) of patients undergoing surgeries in the ward. The infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may be related to the older age, comorbidities, malignant tumor, and surgery in gynecologic hospitalizations. By February 20, 2020, only two of the three patients had met the clinical discharge criteria. Given the long and uncertain incubation period of COVID-19, screening for the virus infection should be carried out for all patients, both preoperatively and postoperatively. Postponement of scheduled gynecologic surgery for patients in the epidemic area should be considered.},
