    abstract = {Neurologists are used to uncertainty - diagnoses are frequently challenging, too often there are limited treatment options, and unpredictable prognoses are our bread and butter. When colleagues struggle to communicate bad news, they regularly turn to us. We practice staying steady and calm amidst our patients' fears, confusion, suffering, and anxiety. We listen, perform detailed exams, and do our best to provide helpful insights. This emphasis on listening and thoughtful problem solving is the core of our art and should be front and center as we partner with colleagues to face an unprecedented set of challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic.},
