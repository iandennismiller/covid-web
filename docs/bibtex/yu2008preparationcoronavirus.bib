    abstract = {The common respiratory viruses, including influenza A, influenza B, and newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, may cause similar clinical symptoms. Therefore, differential diagnosis of these virus pathogens is frequently required for single clinical samples. In addition, there is an urgent need for noninfectious and stable RNA standards and controls for multivirus detection. In this study, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting of the RNAs of influenza A and influenza B viruses and SARS coronavirus was performed, and the resulting products were spliced into a fragment which was packaged into armored RNA for use as a noninfectious, quantifiable synthetic substitute. Furthermore, in the present study we developed a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay in which the armored RNA was used as an external positive control and the three RNA viruses could be detected simultaneously in a single reaction mix. The detection limit of the multiplex real-time PCR was 10 copies/μl of armored RNA. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology. },
