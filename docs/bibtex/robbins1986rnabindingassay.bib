    abstract = {RNA-binding proteins of coronavirus MHV-A59 were identified using an RNA overlay-protein blot assay (ROPBA). The major viral RNA-binding protein in virions and infected cells was the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N (50K). A new 140K virus structural protein was identified as a minor RNA-binding protein both in virions and in infected cells. The 140K protein was antigenically related to N, and upon reduction, yielded only 50K N. Thus, the 140K protein is probably a trimer of N subunits linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Several cellular RNA-binding proteins were also detected. RNA-binding of N was not nucleotide sequence specific. Single-stranded RNA of MHV, VSV, or cellular origin, a DNA probe of the MHV leader sequence, and double-stranded bovine rotavirus RNA could all bind to N. Binding of MHV RNA was optimal between pH 7 and 8, and the RNA could be eluted in 0.1 M Na. Cl. The ROPBA is a useful method for the initial identification of RNA-binding proteins, such as N and the 140K protein of murine coronavirus. Â© 1986.},
