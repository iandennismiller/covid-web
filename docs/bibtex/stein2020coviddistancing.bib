    abstract = {I would like to thank Dr. Thomson for the very pertinent and relevant points that he raised in his thoughtful letter Where are we now with COVID-19? [1]. As my response will illustrate, and in what probably will become a defining feature of conversations surrounding COVID-19 for quite some time, attempts to answer will only make room for more questions. As COVID-19 is unfolding, every day is marked by novel developments. Since the editorial went to press [2], the outbreak has expanded considerably. Over 128,000 individuals were infected worldwide as of March 13, 2020, leading to 4720 deaths [3]. In early March, while the outbreak in China appeared to start to subside [4], it started to amplify in Europe and the United States. The first fatality in the United States occurred on February 29, 2020 in a suburb of Seattle. On March 4m the first death was reported outside WA state, in CA, and was the 11(th) death in the United States. On March 6, the first two fatalities were reported in Florida. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic [5].},
