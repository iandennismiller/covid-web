    abstract = {Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an etiological agent associated with winter dysentery (WD), prevalent in adult cattle during the winter. Although we previously detected, isolated, and characterized BCoV strains from adult cattle with WD (WD-BCoV strains) during the winter in South Korea, the precise epidemiology, as well as the causative agent of diarrhea in adult cattle in the warmer seasons, has not been examined. We examined 184 diarrheic fecal specimens collected from 75 herds of adult cattle from seven provinces during the spring (warm), autumn (warm), and summer (hot) seasons. Bovine coronavirus-positive reactions were detected for 107 (58.2%) diarrheic fecal samples (in 47/75 herds). Of these 107 positive samples, 90 fecal samples from 33 herds tested positive for BCoV alone and 17 fecal samples from 14 herds also tested positive for other pathogens. Biological comparisons between the 9 BCoV strains isolated in this study and the 10 previously isolated WD-BCoV strains revealed that there was no receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) activity against mouse erythrocytes in the 9 BCoV strains but the 10 WD-BCoV strains had high RDE activity. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike (S) and hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) proteins revealed that all the Korean BCo. Vs clustered together regardless of season and were distinct from the other known BCo. Vs, suggesting a distinct evolutionary pathway for the Korean BCo. Vs. These and previous results revealed a high prevalence and widespread geographical distribution of BCoV, suggesting that this virus is endemic in adult cattle with diarrhea in all seasons in South Korea.
