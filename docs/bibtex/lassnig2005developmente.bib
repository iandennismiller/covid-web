    abstract = {Human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E is a group 1 coronavirus and is specific to humans. So far, no animal model is available to study the pathogenesis of infection by HCoV-229E. We show here that the expression of aminopeptidase N (APN, also termed CD13), the receptor for HCoV-229E, is required but not sufficient to confer susceptibility in vivo. HCoV-229E infection was facilitated by crossing APN transgenic mice into signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 1 null mice and by adaptation of HCoV-229E to grow in primary APN transgenic, Stat1 null fibroblasts. Double transgenic mice allow the study of human coronavirus group 1 infections in an animal model, in particular, viral tropism, replication, recombination, and spread in an immunocompromised situation. Furthermore, these mice provide an important tool for the evaluation of biosafety and efficacy of coronavirus-based vectors. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},
