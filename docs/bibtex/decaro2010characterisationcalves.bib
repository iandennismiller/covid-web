    abstract = {Recently, a coronavirus strain (179/07-11) was isolated from water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and the virus which displayed a strict genetic and biological relatedness with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was referred to as bubaline coronavirus (Bu. CoV). Here, we report the characterisation of four Bu. CoVs strains identified in the faeces or intestinal contents of water buffalo calves with acute gastroenteritis. Single Bu. CoV infections were detected in all but one cases from which two clostridia species were also isolated. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 5' end of the spike-protein gene showed that three Bu. CoVs were closely related to the prototype strain 179/07-11, whereas the fourth isolate (339/08-C) displayed a higher genetic identity to recent BCoV reference strains. Three strains adapted to the in vitro grow on human rectal tumour cells were also evaluated for their ability to replicate in a bovine cell line (Madin Darby bovine kidney) and to cause haemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes and all displayed biological properties similar to those already described for the prototype Bu. CoV. The present report shows that albeit genetically heterogeneous, the different Bu. CoV strains possess a common biological pattern which is different from most BCoV and BCoV-like isolates. },
