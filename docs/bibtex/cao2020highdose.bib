    abstract = {The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in China. Until now, no definite effective treatment has been identified. We reported on 3 patients with severe COVID-19 who received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) with satisfactory recovery. Based on these observations, randomized studies of high-dose IVIg should be considered in deteriorating patients infected with COVID-19.},
