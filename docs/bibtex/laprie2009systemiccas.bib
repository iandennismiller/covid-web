    abstract = {Background: A disease resembling feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) has been recognized recently in ferrets, mostly in United States and in Spain. This disease is due to a Group 1 Coronavirus, closely related to the ferret enteric Coronavirus. Objective: To demonstrate the viral origin of severe pyogranulomatous lymphoid and visceral lesions in three ferrets. Methods: Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of lesions received in our laboratory. Results: Severe pyogranulomatous inflammation was observed in the abdominal lymph nodes and in various organs. Positive labelling of Coronavirus antigen was demonstrated in macrophages in the pyogranulomatous lesions by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: The three cases of severe pyogranulomatous disseminated inflammation were due to a Coronavirus, causing a systemic coronavirosis in ferret with a high similarity to FIP. © 2009 AFVAC.},
