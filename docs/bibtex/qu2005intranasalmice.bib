    abstract = {SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) strain GZ50 was partially purified and inactivated with 1:2000 formaldehyde. In cell culture the inactivated virus blocked the replication of live virus by decreasing the TCID 5.0 of the live virus 10 3.6 to 10 4.6 times. Inactivated GZ50 was used to immunize mice intranasally either alone, or after precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), or with CpG, or CTB as an adjuvant. The titer of serum neutralizing antibodies was up to 1:640. In mice immunized with adjuvants or PEG precipitated GZ50, specific IgA was detected in tracheal-lung wash fluid by immunofluorescence. Though serum antibodies were detected, no anti-SARS-IgA could be detected in mice immunized only with inactivated GZ50. The roles of adjuvants in intranasal immunization with inactivated. SARS-CoV is discussed. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. },
