    abstract = {Coronavirus‐like particle(s) (CVLP) are faecal‐derived pleomorphic membrane bound virus‐like particles characterised by a fringe of clubshaped spikes that measure about 27 nm in length. The association of CVLP with a variety of social, clinical, and epidemiological factors was examined after a 69 month survey of faeces received for routine testing at an infectious diseases hospital. CVLP was found most commonly in three groups: first, intellectually retarded individuals who were usually inmates of institutions; second, recent overseas travellers who were either Indochinese refugees/immigrants or were overseas travellers who had usually visited developing communities for lengthy periods; and, third, male homosexuals who had a history of multiple sexual contacts and/or venereal disease. It was concluded that the excretion of CVLP had a strong association with unhygienic living or working conditions irrespective of any clinical symptoms the individual might show.
