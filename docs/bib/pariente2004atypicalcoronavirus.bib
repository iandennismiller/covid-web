    abstract = {A new respiratory illness, designated as atypical pneumonia, produces in 20% of the cases a much more serious disease termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which can be fatal in 5% of the cases. Delayed diagnosis and treatment are the underlying causes for the development of SARS. Measures for the management of the disease should be taken swiftly, based on clinical symptoms, definite contact and isolation of the virus. Current treatment of SARS involves antiviral agents, such as ribavirin, and corticosteroids. © 2003 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits réservés.},
