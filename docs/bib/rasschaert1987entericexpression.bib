    abstract = {The sequence of the 3′-most 8300 nucleotides of the genome RNA of the Purdue-115 strain of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV, a porcine coronavirus, was determined from cDNA clones. The available sequence corresponds to the part of the genome (total length > 20 kb) expressed through subgenomic mRNAs. The 5 subgenomic and the genomic RNA species detected in TGEV-infected cells form a 3′-coterminal 'nested' structure, a unique feature of Coronaviridae. The transcription initiation site of the TGEV subgenomic RNAs appears to involve the hexameric sequence 5′CTAAAC, which is present upstream from each coding region. In addition to the previously identified genes encoding the three structural proteins, E2, E1 and N, two regions, X1 and X2, corresponding to the non-overlapping portion of mRNAs 4 and 3, may code for so far unidentified non-structural polypeptides. The predicted X1 polypeptide (9.2 kDa) is highly hydrophobic. The sequence of the X2 region allows the translation of two non-ovelapping products, i.e., X2a (7.7 kDa).and x2b (18.8 kDa). No RNA species liable to express the extreme 3′ open reading frame X3 was found. © 1987.},
