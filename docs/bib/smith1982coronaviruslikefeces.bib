    abstract = {Coronavirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in normal and diarrhea stool specimens from baboons, chimpanzees, macaques, and marmosets. There was a high prevalence of particles in both normal and diarrhea stools of older animals, whereas stools from nonweaned animals rarely contained these coronavirus-like particles. },
