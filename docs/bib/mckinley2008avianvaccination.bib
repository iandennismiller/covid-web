    abstract = {In this study, we were interested in determining if high titered egg adapted modified live infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccines contain spike gene related quasispecies that undergo selection in chickens, following vaccination. We sequenced the spike glycoprotein of 12 IBV vaccines (5 different serotypes from 3 different manufacturers) directly from the vaccine vial, then compared that sequence with reisolated viruses from vaccinated and contact-exposed birds over time. We found differences in the S1 sequence within the same vaccine serotype from different manufacturers, differences in S1 sequence between different vaccine serials from the same manufacturer, and intra-vaccine differences or quasispecies. Comparing the sequence data of the reisolated viruses with the original vaccine virus, we were able to identify in vivo selection of viral subpopulations as well as mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing selection of a more fit virus subpopulation as well as mutations associated with replication of modified live IBV vaccine viruses in chickens. This information is important for our understanding of how attenuated virus vaccines, including potential vaccines against the SARS-CoV, can ensure long-term survival of the virus and can lead to changes in pathogenesis and emergence of new viral pathogens. This information is also valuable for the development of safer modified live coronavirus vaccines.},
