    abstract = {Clinical and experimental evidence implicate TNF as a possible mediator of the severe immune-based pulmonary injury which can follow infection with H5N1 influenza and SARS coronavirus. Compared with the use of corticosteroids, the use of biologic TNF inhibitors, including etanercept, has the potential to be a more specific and more effective method of ameliorating the severe alveolar damage which can occur following infection with these agents. Further study is indicated.},
