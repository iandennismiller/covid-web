    abstract = {The pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in cats and ferrets is poorly described, and the distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV, in the respiratory tracts of these species is unknown. We observed SARS-CoV antigen expression and lesions in the respiratory tracts of 4 cats and 4 ferrets at 4 days postinoculation and ACE2 expression in the respiratory tracts of 3 cats and 3 ferrets without infection. All infected cats and ferrets had diffuse alveolar damage associated with SARS-CoV antigen expression. A novel SARS-CoV- associated lesion was tracheo-bronchoadenitis in cats. SARS-CoV antigen expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes and serous cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands of cats and in type II pneumocytes of ferrets. ACE2 expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes, tracheo-bronchial goblet cells, serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in cats, and type II pneumocytes and serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in ferrets. In conclusion, the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in cats and ferrets resembles that in humans except that syncytia and hyaline membranes were not observed. The identification of tracheo-bronchoadenitis in cats has potential implications for SARS pathogenesis and SARS-CoV excretion. Finally, these results show the importance of ACE2 expression for SARS-CoV infection in vivo: whereas ACE2 expression in type I and II pneumocytes in cats corresponded to SARS-CoV antigen expression in both cell types, expression of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV antigen in ferrets was limited mainly to type II pneumocytes.},
