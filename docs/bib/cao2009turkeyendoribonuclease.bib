    abstract = {Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) polyprotein was predicted to be cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsp2 to nsp16), but none of these nsps have been characterized. TCoV nsp15 consists of 338 residues and shares 40% sequence similarity to U-specific Nidovirales endoribonuclease (NendoU) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Objective: The purpose of the present study was to characterize TCoV nsp15. Methods: The TCoV nsp15 gene was cloned into pTriEX1 and expressed as a C-terminal His-tagged recombinant protein in BL21 (DE3). The recombinant nsp15 was purified by Ni-NTA resin. Synthetic RNA substrates were used to determine the substrate specificity of the TCoV nsp15. RNA zymography was used to determine the active form of the nsp15. Results: The TCoV nsp15 did not cleave DNA but degraded total cellular RNA. The TCoV nsp15 cleaved single-stranded (ss) RNA at the uridylate site. The TCoV nsp15 cleaved hairpin RNA, pRNA, and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of infectious bursal disease virus very slowly, implying that dsRNA is not a good substrate for the TCoV nsp15. No divalent metal ion was required for in vitro enzymatic activity of the TCoV nsp15. The active form of the TCoV nsp15 was a homohexamer and disulfide bond was essential for the enzymatic activity. Conclusion: The TCoV nsp15 is a NendoU but has some characteristics different from other NendoU. Copyright Â© 2008 S. Karger AG.},
