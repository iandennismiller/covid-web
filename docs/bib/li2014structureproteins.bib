    abstract = {Background: Coronavirus envelope (CoV E) proteins have a predicted β-coil-γ motif reported to target the Golgi complex. Results: This conserved domain forms α-structure on its own but is α-helical in the context of full-length SARS-CoV E protein. Conclusion: This domain is potentially involved in large conformational transitions. Significance: This is the first structural data of the extramembrane domain of any coronavirus E protein. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},
