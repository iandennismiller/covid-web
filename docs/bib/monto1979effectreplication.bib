    abstract = {The effects of the cyclic nucleotide, dibutyryl cyclic AMP on growth of the human coronavirus OC43 were evaluated. Systems used were the permissive cell line BS-C-1, and WI-38. There was no effect of the nucleotide when cell culture adapted virus was grown in BS-C-1. However, enhancement of growth in the presence of cyclic AMP was observed when the virus used was non-cell culture adapted and when WI-38 was employed. Such enhancement may be of value in attempts at growing non-adapted coronaviruses in cell cultures. },
