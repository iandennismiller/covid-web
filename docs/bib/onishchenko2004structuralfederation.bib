    abstract = {Complete nucleotide cDNA sequence (29715 nucleotides) of SARS-associated coronavirus (strain SoD) isolated for the first time in the territory of the Russian Federation was determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed maximum similarity between strain SoD genome and Frankfurt 1 strain genome. Three nucleotide substitutions determining two amino acid ubstitutions were detected.
