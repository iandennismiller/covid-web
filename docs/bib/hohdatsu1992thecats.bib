    abstract = {The types of feline coronaviruses that are prevalent throughout Japan were determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) Type II and neutralizing test using Type IIFIPV as challenge virus. A total of 1,079 cat serum samples were tested by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay for FIPV Type II antigen, all 42 sample from natural cases of FIP, 138 of 647 (21.3%) from cases with some chronic diseases and 57 of 390 (14.6%) from apparently non-diseased cases were positive. Of the 42 cases with FIP, 29 (69%) and 13 (31%) were found to have infection with FIPV Types I and II, respectively. Of the cases with chronic diseases, 111 (80.4%) were shown to have infection with FIPV or FECV Type I, while 14 (10.1%) with FIPV or FECV Type II. All of the 57 apparently non-diseased cases seemed to have been infected with FIPV or FECV Type I. These results indicated that feline coronavirus Type I is more high prevalent in Japan.
