    abstract = {Detection of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 is a fast and simple screening method. As an effective supplement to RNA testing, antibody detection is of epidemiological significance and an important means to understand the occurrence, development, prognosis, and outcome of COVID-19. However, more medical research is needed on the expression level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the prognosis of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. },
