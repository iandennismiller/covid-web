    abstract = {Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has been reported in many countries, including Hong Kong, the United States, South Korea, China and Thailand. In January 2016, clinical diarrhea similar to that of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) with a lower mortality rate was reported on a swine farm in Lao PDR. Intestine samples were collected from 3-day-old pigs with clinical diarrhea and assayed for the presence of swine enteric coronaviruses. The PCR results were positive for PDCoV but negative for PEDV and TGEV. A phylogenetic tree demonstrated that PDCoV from Lao PDR was grouped separately from PDCoV isolates from China and the USA, but was more closely related to the Chinese isolates than to the US isolates. The full-length genome sequence of the novel PDCoV isolate P1_16_BTL_0116 was determined.},
