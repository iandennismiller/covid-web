    abstract = {Virus-containing electron-dense membrane-bound cytoplasmic bodies are described in tracheal epithelial cells of chickens infected with Infectious Bronchitis Virus and in intestinal epithelial cells of swine infected with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus. Using silver-methenamine staining, phosphotungstic acid staining and acid phosphatase enzyme cytochemical staining of ultra-thin sections, these bodies were shown to be virus-containing secondary lysosomes and residual bodies. The accumulation of viral particles in the lysosomes is suggested to possibly represent an intracellular defense mechanism. However, no morphological alterations were found indicating a destruction of the viruses by the lytic lysosomal enzymes. },
