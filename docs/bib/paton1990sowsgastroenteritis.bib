    abstract = {Eighteen litters of sucking piglets were challenged with one of two strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). During pregnancy, their seronegative dams had been either inoculated intranasally with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), inoculated orally with TGEV or left untreated. On the basis of weight gain, clinical signs and survival, no differences in response to challenge was detected when piglets suckled by PRCV inoculated sows were compared with those suckled by uninoculated sows. Such a difference was evident when the litters of sows successfully pre-immunized with TGEV were compared with those of unicoculated or PRCV-inoculated sows. The possibility of transplacental transmission of PRCV was investigated in two litters born to sows that had been inoculated with this virus in late pregnancy. All sixteen live-born piglets were seronegative for the virus at birth and PRCV was not isolated from tissues taken from two stillborn piglets. Â© 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers b.v.},
