    abstract = {Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was reported from a number of countries in the Middle East and Europe with a reported high mortality rate. MERS-CoV was initially isolated from a patient from Bisha, Saudi Arabia. A recent outbreak of MERS-CoV infection was described in a healthcare facility. Although, the recent publications on this topic had shed light on the epidemiology of the disease, many questions remain to be answered.
