    abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 3CL protease is an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS drugs. In this paper, cinanserin (1) analogs were synthesized and tested for the inhibitory activities against SARS-coronavirus (CoV) 3CL protease by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Four analogs show significant activities, especially compound 26 with an IC50 of 1.06 μM. © 2008 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.},
