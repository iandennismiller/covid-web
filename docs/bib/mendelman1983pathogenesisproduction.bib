    abstract = {Following intracerebral inoculation of 3- to 4-week-old C57 B 16/J mice with coronavirus SD, 23% exhibited neurologic signs within the first week. However, only 6% died. Within the first week after inoculation (AI), we noted a panencephalitis. Prominent demyelination detected in the spinal cord on day 6 continued through day 29 AI. Demyelinated lesions in the spinal cord were either subpial with few inflammatory cells except for macrophages or perivascular with prominent accumulation of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Beginning on day 6 AI, IgG was detected in the lesions. Although an infectious virus was detectable in the CNS only through day 12 AI, viral antigen expression continued through day 24. We concluded that coronavirus SD persists in a nonrecoverable form throughout the initial phase of demyelination, day 6 to day 24 AI. Â© 1983, American Medical Association. },
