    abstract = {A method for the parallel solid-phase synthesis of peptide aldehydes has been developed. Protected amino acid aldehydes obtained by the racemization-free oxidation of amino alcohols with Dess-Martin periodinane were immobilized on threonyl resins as oxazolidines. Following Boc protection of the ring nitrogen to yield the N-protected oxazolidine linker, peptide synthesis was performed efficiently on this resin. A peptide aldehyde library was designed for targeting the SARS coronavirus main protease, SARS-CoV Mpro(also known as 3CLpro), on the basis of three different reported binding modes and supported by virtual screening. A set of 25 peptide aldehydes was prepared by this method and investigated in inhibition assays against SARS-CoV M pro. Several potent inhibitors were found with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. An IC50 of 7.5 μM was found for AcNSTSQ-H and AcESTLQ-H. Interestingly, the most potent inhibitors seem to bind to SARS-CoV Mpro in a noncanonical binding mode. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.},
