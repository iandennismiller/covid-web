    abstract = {Kaye, H. S. (CDC, Atlanta, Ga. 30333), H. B. Marsh and W. R. Dowdle. Sero-epidemiologic survey of coronavirus (strain OC 43) related infections in a children's population. Amer J Epid 94: 43-49, 1971.-Acute and convalescent serum pairs and control sera collected from subjects living in a children's home over a 7-year period (1960-1967) were examined by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test with coronavirus strain OC 43. Ninety-three serologic conversions were observed; 44 were associated with reported illnesses and 49 with no reported illnesses. In three distinct outbreaks during the winter and spring quarter of 1960-1961, 1964-1965, and 1966-1967, 67 conversions occurred. Seroconversions to strain OC 43 were associated with as much as 19% of the respiratory diseases in a single season. Over the 7-year period coronavirus strain OC 43 accounted for 3% of the total 1328 respiratory illnesses. Evidence of preexisting antibody was apparent in one-third of the children showing seroconversions. The HI test was more sensitive for serodiagnosis than the complement-fixaticn test. The major presenting complaints of the children with respiratory disease associated with coronavirus strain OC 43 were sore throat, cough and coryza; the predominating symptoms were pharyngitis, coryza, fever and cervical adenitis.
