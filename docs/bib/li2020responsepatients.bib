    abstract = {In a recent review, we have suggested a neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible role in the causation of acute respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients (J Med Viol doi: 10.1002/jmv.25728), based upon the clinical and experimental data available on the past SARS-CoV-1 and the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this article, we provide new evidences recently reported regarding the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and respond to several comments on our previously published article. In addition, we also discuss the peculiar manifestations of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients and the possible involvement of nervous system. This article is protected by copyright. },
