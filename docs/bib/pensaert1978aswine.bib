    abstract = {Coronavirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in the intestinal contents of pigs during a diarrheal outbreak on 4 swine breeding farms. Diarrhea was reproduced in experimental pigs with one of the isolates, designated CV777, which was found to be distinct from the 2 known porcine coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. },
