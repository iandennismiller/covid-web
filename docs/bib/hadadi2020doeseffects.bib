    abstract = {An 80-year-old man with multiple comorbidities presented to the emergency department with tachypnea, tachycardia, fever and critically low O2 saturation and definitive chest CT scan findings in favor of COVID-19 and positive PCR results in 48 h. He received antiviral treatment plus recombinant human Erythropoietin(rhEPO) due to his severe anemia. After 7 days of treatment, he was discharged with miraculous improvement in his symptoms and hemoglobin level. We concluded that rhEPO could attenuate respiratory distress syndrome and confront the SARS-CoV-2 virus through multiple mechanisms including cytokine modulation, anti-apoptotic effects, leukocyte release from bone marrow, and iron redistribution away from the intracellular virus.
