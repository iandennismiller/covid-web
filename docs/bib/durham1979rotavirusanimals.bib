    abstract = {Ultracentrifuged faeces from a variety of species of domestic animals with diarrhoea were examined by electron microscopy. Rotaviruses were detected in faeces of cattle, pigs and horses from neonates to 6 months of age. Infections were most common in the early post-natal period. Rotavirus infection was usually associated v.ith a history of recurrent outbreaks of severe diarrhoea that. was unresponsive to conventional antibacterial and symptomatic treatment. Coronaviruses were found in faeces of cattle, sheep, deer and horse, and were associated with sudden out-breaks of profuse, watery diarrhoea. A wide range of ages were represented in the infected group_ Direct electron microscopy and immune-electron microscopy of faeces clarified by centrifugation in a microhaematocrit centrifuge, proved to be useful ancillary techniques of examination.
