    abstract = {Sixteen cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets were infected oronasally with CV777 coronavirus on the second or third day of life. Two uninfected piglets were controls. After an incubation period of 22 hours to 36 hours, all principals showed severe diarrhea. The piglets were killed at different time intervals. Viral particles were found in the jejunal villous epithelial cells from 18 hours after infection until four days after the beginning of diarrhea. In the colonic epithelial cells, viral particles and degenerative lesions were found only in the piglet killed 36 hours after onset of diarrhea. Degenerative lesions in the enterocytes began at 18 hours after infection and were most pronounced in the jejunum at the onset of clinical signs. From 24 hours on after the onset of clinical signs, three cell types were found: degenerated virus-containing enterocytes; cuboidal cells; and columnar, highly vacuolated cells containing lipid droplets.
