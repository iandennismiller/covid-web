    abstract = {© 2018 Brandão et al. Avian coronavirus, the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis, occurs as multiple genotypes and lineages, and full genomes are not available for the majority of them. This paper reports the (previously unknown) complete genome sequence of strain D274 of this virus (27,599 nucleotides), isolated from chickens in The Netherlands in 1979.},
