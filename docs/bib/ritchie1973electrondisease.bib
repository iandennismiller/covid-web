    abstract = {Particles morphologically similar to coronaviruses were found in bluecomb infected turkey ceca, the bursa of Fabricius, and embryo intestines, but not in the same tissues of uninfected controls. The particles had diameters ranging from ca. 50 to >150 nm and bore variable numbers of pear or club shaped projections. None had a morphologically distinct organized internal component. The concentration of corona virus like particles (CVLP) was highest in embryo intestine and lowest in poult ceca and paralleled infectivity. The CVLP reacted specifically with antibodies in hyperimmune anti bluecomb turkey serum but not with components of normal turkey serum or antibodies against 4 different coronaviruses. These CVLP appear to be characteristically associated with bluecomb disease and probably represent the infectious agent. Small oblate ellipsoidal particles, 20 x 45 nm, consisting of 2 curved portions fused at their ends were also uniquely associated with bluecomb infection and may represent viral precursors.},
