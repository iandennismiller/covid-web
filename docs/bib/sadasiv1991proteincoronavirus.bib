    abstract = {Viral proteins of two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which have different tissue trophism and serology, were separated on the basis of their isoelectric points (pI). The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be characterized on the basis of variant proteins.
