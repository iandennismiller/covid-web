    abstract = {We report the complete genome sequences of a buffalo coronavirus (Buf. CoV HKU26) detected from the faecal samples of two domestic water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in Bangladesh. They possessed 98-99% nucleotide identities to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) genomes, supporting Buf. CoV HKU26 as a member of Betacoronavirus 1. Nevertheless, Buf. CoV HKU26 possessed distinct accessory proteins between spike and envelope compared to BCoV. Sugar-binding residues in the N-terminal domain of S protein in BCoV are conserved in Buf. CoV HKU26.},
