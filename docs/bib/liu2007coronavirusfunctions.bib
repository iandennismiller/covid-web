    abstract = {Coronavirus envelope protein is a small membrane protein and minor component of the virus particles. It plays important roles in virion assembly and morphogenesis, alteration of the membrane permeability of host cells and virus-host cell interaction. Here we review recent progress in characterization of the biochemical properties, membrane topology and functions of the protein. © 2007 Birkhäuser Verlag.},
