    abstract = {Â© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria. Two porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains (Binh21 and Ha. Noi6) were isolated from two pig farms in North Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes and the Spike and Membrane genes revealed that the two Vietnam PDCo. Vs belong to the same lineage as PDCo. Vs from Thailand and Laos; however, the N genes belonged to the same lineage as PDCo. Vs from the USA, Korea, China, and Hong Kong. The recombination detection program subsequently identified the major parent (S5011 strain) and minor parent (HKU15-44 strain) of the two Vietnam PDCoV strains (p < 0.01).},
