    abstract = {An infection of pigs with the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induces antibodies which neutralize the enteropathogenic transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PRCV to the same titre. In the present study, 10-week-old seronegative pigs (n = 8), pigs immune following TGEV inoculation (n = 4) or pigs immune following aerosol (n = 8) or intragastric inoculation (n = 4) with PRCV were challenged with TGEV. Whereas TGEV-immune pigs were completely protected against challenge, all PRCV-immune pigs showed serological evidence of TGEV replication. Nevertheless, the aerosol or intragastric inoculation with PRCV primed the humoral immune system against TGEV and the TGEV challenge induced a secondary antibody response in most PRCV-immune pigs. Furthermore, all PRCV-immune pigs showed a decrease in the duration of the excretion of infectious TGEV (0-4 days) in comparison with the duration of the virus excretion by seronegative pigs (5-6 days).
