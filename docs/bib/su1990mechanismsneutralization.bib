    abstract = {Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was neutralized more than 109-fold with antibodies of a single specificity [monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)]. Most of the virus was neutralized in the first 2-3 min of a reversible reaction, which was followed by a second phase with a decreased neutralization rate and, in some cases, by a persistent fraction, which was a function of the MAb and of the antibody-to-virus ratio. Neutralization of TGEV is a specific event that requires the location of the epitope involved in the neutralization in the appropriate structural context, which is present in the wild-type virus but not in certain MAb escaping mutants. In neutralization of TGEV by binary combinations of MAbs specific for the same or for different antigenic sites, either no cooperation or a synergistic effect, respectively, was observed. Mechanisms of TGEV neutralization by MAbs were characterized at high, intermediate, and low antibody-to-virus ratios. Under these conditions, mainly three steps of the replication cycle were inhibited: binding of virus to the cell, internalization, and a step that takes place after internalization. In addition, virus aggregation could be responsible for the neutralization of 10 to 20% of virus infectivity. © 1990.},
