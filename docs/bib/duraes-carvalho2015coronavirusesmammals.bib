    abstract = {© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. This study showed that the most of the coronaviruses (Co. Vs) detected in Brazilian wild birds clustered with the mouse hepatitis virus A59 strain, belonging to the Beta. CoV group. Furthermore, CoV detected in two different bird species, Amazona vinacea and Brotogeris tirica, clustered with a CoV isolated from Sparrow (Spa. CoV HKU17) belonging to a monophyletic group related with the Co. Vs isolated from swines (Por. CoV HKU15), both belonging to the Delta. CoV genus, previously unreported in South America. Considering the risk of inter-species host switching and further adaptation to new hosts, detection in bird species of Co. Vs closely related to mammal Co. Vs should warn for the potential emergence of new threatening viruses.},
