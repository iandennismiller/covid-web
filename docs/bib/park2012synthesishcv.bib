    abstract = {Aryl diketoacid (ADK) is well known for antiviral activity which can be enhanced by introduction of an aromatic arylmethyl substituent. A natural flavonoid quercetin has a 3,5-dihydroxychromone pharmacophore which is in bioisosteric relationship with the 1,3-diketoacid moiety of the ADK. Thus, it was of our interest to test the antiviral activity of the quercetin derivatives with an arylmethyl group attached. In this study, we prepared a series of the 7-O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives with various aromatic substituents and evaluated their antiviral activity against the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV, SCV) as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV). Single difference in the aromatic substituent fine-tuned the biological activity of the 7-O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives to result in two different classes of derivatives selectively active against SCV and HCV.
