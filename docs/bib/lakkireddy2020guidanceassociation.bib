    abstract = {Covid-19 is a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc with the health and economy of much of human civilization. Electrophysiologists have been impacted personally and professionally by this global catastrophe. In this joint document from representatives of the HRS, ACC and AHA we identify the potential risks of exposure to patients, allied health care staff, industry representatives and hospital administrators. We describe the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmias and methods of triage based on acuity and patient comorbidities. We provide guidance for managing invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology procedures, clinic visits and cardiac device interrogations. We discuss resource conservation and the role of tele-medicine in remote patient care along with management strategies for affected patients.},
