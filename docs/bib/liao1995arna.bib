    abstract = {Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, generates defective-interfering (DI) RNAs of different sizes during passages at high multiplicities of infection. All MHV DI RNAs characterized so far contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a fused viral protein; in addition, DI RNAs with a long ORF have a competitive advantage over those with a shorter ORF. These findings suggest that DI RNA replication may require an ORF encoding a cis-acting viral protein. In this study, we used a naturally occurring DI RNA and inserted a 12-nucleotide (nt) amber-mutation linker at various positions to truncate the ORF. Most of the mutants replicated as well as the wild-type DI RNA, irrespective of the presence or absence and the length of the ORF in the RNA. Sequence analysis showed that all of the mutants retained the insertional mutations even after two viral passages in tissue culture, establishing that the mutant DI RNAs replicated. We have further introduced two 3-nucleotide substitutions of the first two AUG codons of the ORF, thus completely closing the ORF. This DI RNA replicated as well as the wild-type DL but, after a single passage, the majority of the mutant RNAs was replaced by recombinant RNAs which contain a restored functional ORF. However, an additional insertion of a 12-nt amber-mutation linker downstream of the AUG substitutions prevented recombination, and the DI RNA still replicated. These data indicate that DI RNA replication does not require a DI-specific ORF encoding cis-acting viral proteins and that a 12-nucleotide insertion could prevent or delay the occurrence of RNA recombination, suggesting the importance of direct or indirect RNA alignment in homologous RNA recombination.
