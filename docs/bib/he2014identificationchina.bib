    abstract = {Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like Co. Vs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe, and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet SARS Co. Vs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS Co. Vs. Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS Co. Vs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like Co. Vs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS Co. Vs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like Co. Vs. IMPORTANCE Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like Co. Vs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like Co. Vs and human SARS Co. Vs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like Co. Vs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like Co. Vs circulating in Yunnan Province. Â© 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},
