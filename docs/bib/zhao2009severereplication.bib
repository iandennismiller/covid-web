    abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes several accessory proteins of unknown function. One of these proteins, protein 6 (p6), which is encoded by ORF6, enhances virus replication when introduced into a heterologous murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) but is not essential for optimal SARS-CoV replication after infection at a relatively high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Here, we reconcile these apparently conflicting results by showing that p6 enhances SARS-CoV replication to nearly the same extent as when expressed in the context of MHV if cells are infected at a low MOI and accelerates disease in mice transgenic for the human SARS-CoV receptor.
