    abstract = {Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has seriously affected the treatment of patients and social stability. In the later stage of disease, some COVID-19 patients may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure. However, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease is cytokine storm. At present, some therapies such as interleukin-6 antibody blocker, stem cell therapy, and transfusion of convalescent plasma have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm and have made some progress. This article reviews the influences of cytokine storm syndrome on the COVID-19 and the corresponding immunotherapies to resist cytokine storm.},
