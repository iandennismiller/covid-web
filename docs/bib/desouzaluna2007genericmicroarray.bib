    abstract = {A nonfluorescent low-cost, low-density oligonucleotide array was designed for detecting the whole coronavirus genus after reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The limit of detection was 15.7 copies/reaction. The clinical detection limit in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome was 100 copies/sample. In 39 children sufering from coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1, the sensitivity was equal to that of individual real-time RT-PCRs. Copyright Â© 2007, American Society for Microbiology. },
