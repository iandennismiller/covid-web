    abstract = {Ferret systemic coronavirus infection (FSCV) is a systemic disease in ferrets that clinically and pathologically resembles the dry form of FIP. The present study describes abdominal imaging features of 11 ferrets with FSCV. Abdominal survey radiographs were available for eight ferrets and ultrasound examination for all cases. Loss of lumbar musculature, decreased peritoneal detail, presence of mid-abdominal soft-tissue masses and splenomegaly were the most significant radiographic signs in these patients. Ultrasonographic findings including peritonitis, abdominal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, abdominal soft-tissue masses, nephromegaly and changes in the renal cortex echogenicity were recorded in the majority of cases with FSCV. As an imaging modality, ultrasound is superior to radiology when abdominal contrast is reduced, as it frequently occurs in these cases. However, although imaging techniques provide additional information in the antemortem diagnosis, they can not replace the definitive diagnosis based on histological and immunohistochemical results.},
