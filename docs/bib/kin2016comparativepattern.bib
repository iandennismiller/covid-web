    abstract = {Bovine coronaviruses (BCo. Vs) are widespread around the world and cause enteric or respiratory infections among cattle. The current study includes 13 samples from BCo. Vs collected in Normandy during an 11-year period (from 2003 to 2014), 16 French HCoV-OC43s, and 113 BCo. Vs or BCo. Vs-like sequence data derived from partial or complete genome sequences available on Gen. Bank. According to a genotyping method developed previously for HCoV-OC43, BCo. Vs and BCo. Vs-like are distributed on three main sub-clusters named C1, C2, and C3. Sub-cluster C1 includes BCo. Vs and BCo. Vs-like from America and Asia. Sub-cluster C2 includes BCo. Vs from Europe. Sub-cluster C3 includes prototype, vaccine, or attenuated BCoV strains. The phylogenetic analyses revealed the monophyletic status of the BCo. Vs from France reported here for the first time. Moreover, BCoV exhibits a relative genetic stability when compared to HCoV-OC43 we previously described from the same region. The numerous recombination detected between HCoV-OC43 were much less frequent for BCoV. The analysis points thus to the influence of different evolutive constraints in these two close groups.},
