    abstract = {Coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infection and a coryzal syndrome. Although described as a cause of gastroenteritis in HIV patients, with the exception of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is little in the literature about respiratory infection in HIV patients. We describe two patients with HIV, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and proven coronavirus infection. A third patient presented with an upper respiratory tract infection but coronavirus was not isolated. All three men had spent a day decorating the first patient's flat four days prior to presentation. This is the first description of respiratory tract infection with coronavirus in HIV patients. Both patients with coronavirus required prolonged admission to hospital and extensive investigations because they were HIV infected. Coronavirus is often associated with less severe upper respiratory tract infection but can cause more severe disease and should be considered in patients with HIV and respiratory tract infection.},
