    abstract = {Fecal and nasal samples were collected from 180 calves with diarrhea and 36 clinically normal co-habitants, and tested for virus using HRT-18 cell cultures derived from human rectal adenocarcinoma. A cytopathic virus was isolated from 5 fecal and 56 nasal samples obtained from diarrheic calves. All calves in which the virus was isolated from diarrheic feces were positive for virus isolation from nasal swabs. The virus was also isolated from the nasal swabs of 10 clinically normal calves that were co-habitants with diarrheic calves. Because they were morphologically similar to Coronavirus, agglutinated mouse erythrocytes and serologically identical with the Nebraska calf diarrhea Coronavirus, new isolates were identified as bovine Coronavirus. The demonstration of viral antigens in nasal epithelial cells by a direct immunofluorescence was in close agreement with the virus isolation in HRT-18 cell cultures. This is the first report on the isolation of bovine Coronavirus from newborn calves with diarrhea in Japan. The evidence that the virus was frequently isolated from nasal swabs is of great interest for understanding the pathogenesis of bovine Coronavirus infection.
