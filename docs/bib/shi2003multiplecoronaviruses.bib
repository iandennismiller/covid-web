    abstract = {In this paper, we report a multiple sequence alignment result on the basis of 10 amino acid sequences of the M protein, which come from different coronaviruses (4 SARS-associated and 6 others known). The alignment model was based on the profile HMM (Hidden Markov Model), and the model training was implemented through the SAHMM (Self-Adapting Hidden Markov Model) software developed by the authors.
