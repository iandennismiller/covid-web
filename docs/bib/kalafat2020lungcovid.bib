    abstract = {Imaging modalities play a crucial role in the management of suspected COVID-19-infected patients. Before reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results are positive, 60-93% of patients have positive chest computed tomographic (CT) findings consistent with COVID-19 infection. We report a case of positive lung ultrasound findings consistent with COVID-19 in a woman with an initial negative RT-PCR result. The lung ultrasound-imaging findings were present between the negative and subsequent positive RT-PCR tests and correlated with CT findings. The point-of-care lung-ultrasound examination was easy to perform and, as such, could play an important role in the triage of women with suspected COVID-19. The neonatal swabs, cord blood, and placental swab RT-PCR tests were negative for SARS-CoV-2, a finding consistent with the published literature suggesting no vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women.
