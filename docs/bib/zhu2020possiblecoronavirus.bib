    abstract = {IMPACT: The possible reason about non-susceptibility of children to coronavirus may lie in different angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and immunity of children. The first possible reason is about ACE activity. A research revealed that children had higher ACE activities. The next possible reason is about immunity. Some adjuvant drug such as thymosin may provide benefit help for 2019-nCoV patients.},
