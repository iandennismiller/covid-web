We report here the complete genome sequences of four human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 isolates generated using targeted viral nucleic acid capture and next-generation sequencing; the isolates were collected in New Mexico and Arkansas, USA, in February (HCoV-OC43/USA/TCNP_0070/2016) and March (HCoV-OC43/USA/ACRI_0052/2016) 2016 and January 2017 (HCoV-OC43/USA/TCNP_00204/2017 and HCoV-OC43/USA/TCNP_00212/2017).},
