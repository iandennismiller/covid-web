    abstract = {The emergence of the novel virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has caused a global pandemic called Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and has become one of the most significant challenges to the healthcare profession. Dental practices are focal points for cross-infection and care must be taken to minimise the risk of infection to, from, or between dental care professionals and patients. The COVID-19 disease epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children's symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience. It is unknown whether certain groups, for example, children with comorbidities, might be at a higher risk of more severe illness. Emerging data on disease spread in children, affected by COVID-19 has not been presented in detail. The purpose of this article is to report current data on the paediatric population affected with COVID-19 and highlight considerations for dentists providing care for children during this pandemic. All members of the dental team have a professional responsibility to keep themselves informed of current guidance and be vigilant in updating themselves as recommendations are changing so quickly.},
