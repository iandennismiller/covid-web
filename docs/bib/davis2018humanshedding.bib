Background: The prevalence, symptom course, and shedding in persons infected with the 4 most common human coronaviruses (HCoV)-229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 are poorly described. Objectives: We estimate their prevalence and associated symptoms among college students identified via a social network study design. Patients/Methods: We collected 1-3 samples (n = 250 specimens) from 176 participants between October 2012 and January 17, 2013: participants with acute respiratory infection (ARI; cough and body aches or chills or fever/feverishness) and their social contacts. Virus was detected using RT-PCR. Results: 30.4% (76/250) of specimens tested positive for any virus tested, and 4.8% (12/250) were positive for 2 or more viruses. Human coronaviruses (HCo. Vs [22.0%; 55/250]), rhinovirus (7.6%; 19/250), and influenza A (6.4%; 16/250) were most prevalent. Symptoms changed significantly over time among ARI participants with HCoV: the prevalence of cough and chills decreased over 6 days (P =.04, and P =.01, respectively), while runny nose increased over the same period (P =.02). HCoV-NL63 was the most frequent virus detected 6 days following symptom onset (8.9%), followed by rhinovirus (6.7%). Conclusions: During a 3-month period covering a single season, HCo. Vs were common, even among social contacts without respiratory symptoms; specific symptoms may change over the course of HCoV-associated illness and were similar to symptoms from influenza and rhinovirus.},
