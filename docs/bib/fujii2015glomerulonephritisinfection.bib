    abstract = {© 2015, The Author(s). A male domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo), which was purchased from outside of Japan at 13 weeks of age, was euthanized at 18 months of age because of poor health. At autopsy, the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node were enlarged, and white foci were observed on the outer surface of the liver. The outer surface of the mesenteric lymph node was dark red. Histologically, granulomas were observed in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, composed mainly of aggregated epithelioid macrophages, some of which were positive to an anti–feline coronavirus (FCoV; Alphacoronavirus 1) antibody in immunohistochemistry. Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis was observed, and periodic acid–Schiff-positive deposits were observed along glomerular capillary walls. These deposits stained pale red with periodic acid–methenamine silver stain and red with Masson trichrome stain, and were also observed in the mesangial matrix. In affected glomeruli, glomerular capillary walls and mesangial areas were positive for anti-ferret immunoglobulin G. By electron microscopy, subepithelial and mesangial electron-dense deposits were observed consistent with immune complex deposition. The deposition of immune complexes may have been associated with FCoV infection.},
