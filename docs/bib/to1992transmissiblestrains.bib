    abstract = {Three strains of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) possessing different degrees of pathogenicity for piglets were examined for their capacity to express M and S glycoproteins on the infected cell surface using a microwell immunoperoxidase test. These two viral glycoproteins were easily detected on the plasma membrane of 0.1 % paraformaldehyde-fixed swine testis (ST) or pig kidney (RP. D) cells which were infected with high-passaged Purdue-115 and low-passaged D-52 strains and a high-passaged attenuated (188-SG) mutant of TGEV. No significant differences were found between attenuated and virulent strains with regard to the viral antigen expression on the membrane of infected cells over a 14-h period. © 1992 Éditions Scientifiques Elsevier, Paris.},
