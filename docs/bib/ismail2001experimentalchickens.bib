    abstract = {The DB2 calf strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was used to inoculate 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) turkey poults in three trials. In all trials, the birds developed clinical signs of enteritis at 48-72 hr postinoculation. Birds euthanatized at 3, 5, and 7 days postinoculation (DPI) had flaccid, pale intestines with watery contents, and the ceca were markedly enlarged with frothy contents. Coronavirus particles were detected by immune electron microscopy with BCV antibodies from the intestinal contents of birds killed at 3, 5, 7, and 12 DPI. Body weights of inoculated poults killed at 3, 5, and 7 DPI were significantly reduced as compared with controls. Hemagglutinating antibodies were detected in sera of convalescent birds at 12 DPI. However, experimental inoculation of 1-day-old SPF chicks in two trials with the same virus resulted in no clinical signs or macroscopic or microscopic lesions. No coronaviruses were detected from intestinal contents, and there were no significant differences in body weights of inoculated and noninoculated control chicks.},
