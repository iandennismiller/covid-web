    abstract = {Bovine coronavirus isolates from eight different states of the USA were compared for their antigenic properties and susceptibility to hygromycin B. Antigenic differences were observed among the isolates in a one-way hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using a polyclonal antiserum against the Mebus bovine coronavirus isolate. Differences were observed on isoelectric focusing among viral proteins with isoelectric points between 4.45-4.65. Most of the BCV isolates were susceptible to hygromycin B (0.5mM) whereas a few hygromycin B resistant isolates were also found. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.},
