    abstract = {© American Roentgen Ray Society. Objective. The purpose of this article is to retrospectively analyze chest CT findings for 15 patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and to identify features associated with survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were assigned to group 1 if they died (n = 9) and to group 2 if they made a full recovery (n = 6). Two reviewers scored chest radiographs and CT examinations for segmental involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. Results. Eight patients had ground-glass opacity (53%), five had ground-glass and consolidation in combination (33%), five had pleural effusion (33%), and four patients had interlobular thickening (27%). Of 281 CT findings, 151 (54%) were peripheral, 68 (24%) were central, and 62 (22%) had a mixed location. The number of involved lung segments was higher in group 1. The lower lobe was more commonly involved (mean, 12.2 segments) than in the upper and middle lobes combined (mean, 6.3 segments). The mean number of lung segments involved was 12.3 segments in group 1 and 3.4 segments in group 2. The CT lung score (mean ± SD, 15.78 ± 7.9 vs 7.3 ± 5.7, p = 0.003), chest radiographic score (20.8 ± 1.7 vs 5.6 ± 5.4; p = 0.001), and mechanical ventilation duration (13.11 ± 8.3 vs 0.5 ± 1.2 days; p = 0.002) were higher in group 1. All nine group 1 patients and three of six group 2 patients had pleural effusion (p = 0.52). Conclusion. CT of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus predominantly showed ground-glass opacities, with peripheral lower lobe preference. Pleural effusion and higher CT lung and chest radiographic scores correlate with poor prognosis and short-term mortality.},
