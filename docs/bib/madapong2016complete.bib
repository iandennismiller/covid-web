    abstract = {Â© 2016 Madapong et al. In Thailand, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in November 2015. The virus was isolated from piglets experiencing diarrhea outbreak. Herein, the full-length genome sequence of the Thai PDCoV isolate P23_15_TT_1115 is reported. The results provide a clearer understanding of the molecular characteristics of PDCoV in Thailand.},
