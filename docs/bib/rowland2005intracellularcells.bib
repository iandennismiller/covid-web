    abstract = {The nucleocapsid (N) protein of several members within the order Nidovirales localizes to the nucleolus during infection and after transfection of cells with N genes. However, confocal microscopy of N protein localization in Vero cells infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or transfected with the SARS-CoV N gene failed to show the presence of N in the nucleoplasm or nucleolus. Amino acids 369 to 389, which contain putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nucleolar localization signal motifs, failed to restore nuclear localization to an NLS-minus mutant Rev protein. These data indicate that nuclear localization is not a conserved property among all nidoviruses. Copyright Â© 2005, American Society for Microbiology. },
