    abstract = {The nucleocapsid (N) gene of turkey coronavirus (TCV) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and expressed in the baculovirus expression system. A recombinant baculovirus containing the TCV N gene (rBTCV/N) was identified by polymerase chain reaction and expression of TCV N protein as determined by western immunoblot analysis. Two TCV-specific proteins, 52 and 43 kDa, were expressed by rBTCV/N; one of these proteins, p52, was comparable in size to native TCV N protein. Baculovirus-expressed N proteins were used as antigen in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of TCV-specific antibodies. The ELISA detected antibodies specific for TCV and infectious bronchitis virus, a closely related avian coronavirus, but did not detect antibodies specific for other avian viruses (avian influenza, avian reovirus, avian paramyxovirus 3, avian adenovirus 1, or Newcastle disease virus). These findings indicate that baculovirus-expressed TCV N protein is a suitable source of antigen for ELISA-based detection of TCV-specific antibodies in turkeys.},
