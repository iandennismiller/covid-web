    abstract = {The morphogenesis of a new porcine enteric coronavirus, CV777, in intestinal epithelial cells of experimentally infected newborn piglets is described. The virus shows a morphogenetic pattern characteristic for members of the Coronaviridae family. It is formed by budding through membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Some specific aspects of this morphogenesis are discussed. },
