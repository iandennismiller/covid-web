    abstract = {synthetic way of chiral zirconium quantum dots (Zr QDs) was presented for the first time using L(+)-ascorbic acid acts as a surface as well as chiral ligands. Different spectroscopic and microscopic analysis was performed for thorough characterization of Zr QDs. As-synthesized QDs exhibited fluorescence and circular dichroism properties, and the peaks were located at 412 nm and 352 nm, respectively. MTT assay was performed to test the cytotoxicity of the synthesized Zr QDs against rat brain glioma C6 cells. Synthesized QDs was further conjugated with anti-infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) antibodies of coronavirus to form an immunolink at the presence of the target analyte and anti-IBV antibody-conjugated magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles (MPNPs). The fluorescence properties of immuno-conjugated QD–MP NPs nanohybrids through separation by an external magnetic field enabled biosensing of coronavirus with a limit of detection of 79.15 EID/50 μL.},
