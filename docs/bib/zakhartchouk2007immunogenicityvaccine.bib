    abstract = {We studied the immunogenicity of an anti-SARS subunit vaccine comprised of the fragment of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein amino acids 318-510 (S318-510) containing the receptor-binding domain. The S protein fragment was purified from the culture supernatant of stably transformed HEK293T cells secreting a tagged version of the protein. The vaccine was given subcutaneously to 129S6/Sv. Ev mice in saline, with alum adjuvant or with alum plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Mice immunized with the adjuvanted antigen elicited strong antibody and cellular immune responses; furthermore, adding the CpG ODN to the alum resulted in increased IgG2a antibody titers and a higher number of INF-γ-secreting murine splenocytes. Mice vaccinated with S318-510 deglycosylated by PNGase F (dgS318-510) showed a lower neutralizing antibody response but had similar numbers of INF-γ-producing cells in the spleen. This finding suggests that carbohydrate is important for the immunogenicity of the S318-510 protein fragment and provide useful information for designing an effective and safe SARS subunit vaccine. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. },
