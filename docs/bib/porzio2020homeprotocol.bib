    abstract = {Cancer patients have an increased risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19, and advanced cancer patients who are followed at home, represent a particularly frail population. Although with substantial differences, the challenges which cancer care professionals have to face with during a pandemic are quite similar to those posed by natural disasters. Some of us have already managed the oncological home care service after the 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila (middle Italy). With this letter, we want to share with the medical community the procedures and tools that we have started using at the home care service of the Tuscany Tumor Association during the COVID-19 pandemic.},
