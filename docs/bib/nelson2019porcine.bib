    abstract = {Â© Wildlife Disease Association 2019. Cloacal swab samples collected from 538 migratory waterfowl along the Mississippi Migratory Bird Flyway in 2013 were tested for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine deltacoronavirus. Neither virus was detected in any of the samples, indicating that waterfowl likely did not contribute to the rapid spread of these viruses within central US.},
