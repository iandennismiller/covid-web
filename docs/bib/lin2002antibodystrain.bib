    abstract = {The serum antibody responses of cattle with respiratory coronavirus infections during the pathogenesis of shipping fever pneumonia were analyzed with different bovine coronavirus antigens, including those from a wild-type respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) strain (97TXSF-Lu 15-2) directly isolated from lung tissue from a fatally infected bovine, a wild-type enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus (EBCV) strain (Ly 138-3), and the highly cell culture-adapted, enteric prototype strain (EBCV L9-81). Infectivity-neutralizing (IN) and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) activities were tested. Sequential serum samples, collected during the onset of the respiratory coronavirus infection and at weekly intervals for 5 weeks thereafter, had significantly higher IN and HAI titers for antigens of RBCV strain 97TXSF-Lu15-2 than for the wild-type and the highly cell culture-adapted EBCV strains, with P values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0483. The IN and HAI antibody responses against the two EBCV strains did not differ significantly, but the lowest titers were detected with EBCV strain L9-81.},
