    abstract = {The two surface glycoproteins S and HE of human coronavirus OC43 (HCV- OC43) were isolated from the viral membrane and purified. Only the S protein was able to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, indicating that this viral protein is the major hemagglutinin of HCV-OC43. The receptor determinant recognized by this virus on the surface of erythrocytes is N-acetyl-9-O- acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) which is also used by bovine coronavirus for attachment to cells. By analyzing erythrocytes containing different amounts of Neu5,9Ac2 in either of two linkage types, it was found that there are subtle differences in the affinity of both viruses for 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. Bovine coronavirus was more efficient in recognizing low amounts of Neu5,9Ac2 α2,3 linked to galactose, whereas HCV-OC43 was superior with respect to the α2,6 linkage. The gene coding for the S protein of HCV-OC43 was cloned and sequenced. A large open reading frame predicts a polypeptide of 150 kDa in the unglycosylated form. A protein of about 190 kDa is expected if the 20 potential glycosylation sites are used for attachment of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. These predictions were confirmed by in vitro transcription and translation of the gene in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. A high degree of sequence homology was found between the S proteins of HCV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus. Structural and functional analyses of more strains should help to identify the location of the sialic acid-binding site. © 1993 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.},
