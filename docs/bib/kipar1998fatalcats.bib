    abstract = {This report describes five cases of naturally occurring feline coronavirus enteritis. The affected animals, aged 2 months to 7 years, had a clinical history of intestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea or vomiting, or both. They exhibited variable histological changes in the epithelium of the small intestine, ranging from degeneration of single cells and detachment of groups of cells from the villous tips to regenerative processes of the crypt epithelia. Post-mortem diagnosis was based on the immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen within intestinal epithelial cells and on the electron microscopical demonstration of coronavirus particles in the faeces. In addition, one animal was immunohistochemically positive for antigens of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and exhibited intestinal changes consistent with FeLV-associated enteritis. Two cats were tested serologically for feline immunodeficiency antibodies, with negative results. The findings indicate that natural coronavirus infection is a potential cause of severe enteritis in juvenile and adult cats.},
