    abstract = {Canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) are considered the main pathogens responsible for acute gastroenteritis in dogs. From a collection of 250 samples, seven CPV strains and three CCoV strains were identified in symptomatic Irish dogs. Samples were screened for the viruses using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and typed via DNA sequence analysis. Three CPV strains were characterized as CPV-2a, while four others were characterized as CPV-2b. To date, CPV-2c remains unreported in Ireland. Two CCoV strains were characterized as CCoV-II and one as CCoV-I. In the case of one sample, PH4/09/Ire, a mixed infection with CPV and CCoV was detected. Â© Springer-Verlag 2010.},
