    abstract = {Immune responses to the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid protein were studied using a recombinant-DNA expression product. In mice, a lymphocyte proliferative response and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to IBV were induced upon immunization with this nucleocapsid protein. Next, we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to IBV in chickens. Chickens were primed with nucleocapsid protein and subsequently boosted with inactivated IBV, strain M41. Proliferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres. Finally, an increased tracheal protection against challenge with live IBV was observed. These results indicate that infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsid protein is a relevant target for immune recognition in both the mouse and the chicken. Â© 1992.},
