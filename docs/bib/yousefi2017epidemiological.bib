    abstract = {Â© 2017, National Institute of Health. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was a great global concern in 2014. It has a wide range of manifestations that may differ in each area as well as high mortality. In this study, we report the epidemiological characteristics, history, clinical, and paraclinical information of all 5 patients from Iran with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV. All patients were from Kerman province. None of them had a history of travel, contact with animals, or consumption of camel milk products, however, all of the patients had contact with a person who had been in Saudi- Arabia and experienced respiratory infection. One of the 5 patients was a man and 2 passed away from the disease. Fever and respiratory symptoms were the most common symptoms, and 2 patients had watery diarrhea. Alveolar patterns were observed in all available chest radiograms, and 3 patients had elevated liver aminotransferase levels. Two of these patients had leukopenia, and none had renal failure. In conclusion, the results of this study underscore the need for all patients with acute respiratory symptoms with contact with a person who has recently traveled to Saudi-Arabia and experienced respiratory infection to be investigated for MERS-CoV.},
