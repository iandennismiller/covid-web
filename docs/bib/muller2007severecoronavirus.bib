    abstract = {The global severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was the first pandemic of the 21st century. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled, evidence that SARS emerged from an animal reservoir has raised concerns that another pandemic could occur. This review discusses the likelihood of another SARS pandemic and reviews the epidemiological and clinical features of the disease with an emphasis on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of SARS.
