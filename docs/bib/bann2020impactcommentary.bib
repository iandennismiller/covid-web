    abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis and Otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk of contracting COVID-19. There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for Otolaryngologic surgery in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed relevant publications and position statements regarding the management of Otolaryngology patients in the setting of COVID-19. Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed. RESULTS: Enhanced personal protective equipment (N95 respirator and face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable cap and gown, gloves) is required for any Otolaryngology patient with unknown, suspected, or positive COVID-19 status. Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely, and clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs. CONCLUSION: We summarize current best-practice recommendations for Otolaryngologists to ensure safety for themselves, their clinical staff, and their patients.
