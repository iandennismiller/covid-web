    abstract = {© 2018 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest. Feline enteric coronaviruses have three open reading frames (ORFs) in region 3 (3a, 3b, and 3c). All three ORFs were expressed with C-terminal eGFP and 3xFLAG tags in different cell lines and their localisation was determined. ORF 3a is predicted to contain DNA-binding and transcription activator domains, and it is localised in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. ORF 3b is also predicted to contain DNA-binding and activator domains, and was found to localise in the mitochondrion. Besides that, in some of the non-infected and FIPV-infected cells nucleolar, perinuclear or nuclear membrane accumulation of the eGFP-tagged 3b was observed. The exact compartmental localisation of ORF 3c is yet to be determined. However, based on our co-localisation studies 3c does not seem to be localised in the ER-Golgi network, ERGIC or peroxisomes. The expression of 3c-eGFP is clearly cell type dependent, it is more stable in MARC 145 cells than in Fcwf-4 or CrFK cells, which might reflect in vivo stability differences of 3c in natural target cells (enterocytes vs. monocytes/macrophages).},
