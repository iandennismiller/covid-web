    abstract = {From 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found 2 asymptomatic infections. One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment. Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his TR-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day. We found that there may be virus carriers in asymptomatic population with epidemiological contact history. After 14 days of isolation, asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means the risk of transmission and present a new challenge to home isolation.},
