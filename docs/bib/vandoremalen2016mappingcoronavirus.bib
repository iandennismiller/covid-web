    abstract = {Â© 2016, American Society for Microbiology. The novel emerging coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) binds to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), via 14 interacting amino acids. We previously showed that if the five interacting amino acids which differ between hamster and human DPP4 are changed to the residues found in human DPP4, hamster DPP4 does act as a receptor. Here, we show that the functionality of hamster DPP4 as a receptor is severely decreased if less than 4 out of 5 amino acids are changed.},
