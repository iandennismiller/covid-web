    abstract = {Analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) by either sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation or a virus capture assay using an anti-SCoV S protein antibody demonstrated that the SCoV 6 protein, which is one of the accessory proteins of SCoV, was incorporated into virus particles. Coexpression of the SCoV S, M, E, and 6 proteins was sufficient for incorporation of the 6 protein into virus-like particles. Cells transfected with plasmid expressing the 6 protein released SCoV 6 protein; however, infected cells released SCoV 6 protein only in association with SCoV particles.
