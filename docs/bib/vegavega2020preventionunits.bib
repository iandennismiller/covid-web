    abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is of hich risk for patients on chronic hemodialysis due to their immunosuppressed state, advanced age, and the coexistence of significant comorbidities, in particular cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and others. Additionally, they constitute a closed conglomerate since they come to treatment regularly, spending hours in the treatment places, exposed to a possible acquisition of the infection. Finally, going to their treatment regularly prevents them from remaining in home isolation and with potential exposure. These recommendations summarize the interventions proposed by three international organizations and add some suggested by national experts, with the aim to early identify the patients and health personnel at risk and reducing the risk of infection.},
