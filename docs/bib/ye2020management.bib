    abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of surgical treatment for cancer patients complicated with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The management and clinical outcome of a sigmoid cancer patient with COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS: The inflammation indicators and fever of this patient were effectively controlled and the lung lesions remained stable after active anti-viral treatment, then the radical colorectomy was performed after the viral negative conversion for twice. CONCLUSIONS: The case indicates that it may feasible to undergo radical tumor surgery for cancer patients with COVID-19 after the virus nucleic acid testing turns negative and more studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.},
