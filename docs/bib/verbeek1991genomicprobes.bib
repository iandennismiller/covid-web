    abstract = {Genomic relationships between turkey and bovine coronavirus (TCV and BCV), which are currently placed in distinct antigenic groups, were demonstrated by hybridization using specific cDNA probes. BCV-specific recombinant plasmid probes p 52, p 27, and p 247, holding inserts derived from (probably nonstructural) genes, and plasmids pN 17 and pN 9 holding the N and M gene, respectively, permitted the detection of isolates of both BCV and TCV with similar sensitivities. Similarly, probing supernatants of cell cultures infected with several isolates of TCV, using probes pN 17 and pM 78, respectively holding the N gene of BCV and TCV, resulted in equally intense detection signals. Only a slight detection of MHV-3, which is antigenically related to BCV, was observed, whereas the probes did not allow the detection of IBV, TGEV, and HCV-229E, which are placed in antigenic groups separate from those of BCV and TCV. Detection of TCV was improved by hybridization with BCV-specific single-stranded (ss) probes holding sequences of the N and M genes and synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction. Diagnosis of TCV in 134 clinical samples by hybridization was better with PCR-produced ss BCV-specific probes than with ds PCR-produced probes or a combination of six recombinant plasmid probes holding non-overlapping BCV-specific cDNA sequences. Detection signals were absent when probing clinical samples with32P-labelled pUC-DNA. },
