    abstract = {The histopathology of fasting and bluecomb disease in one-day-old turkey poults inoculated with bluecomb disease coronavirus (BCDCV) was studied. Uninoculated fasting poults produced clinical signs similar to those observed in BCDCV-inoculated poults. No histological changes in the intestines were observed in the fasted poults whereas definite lesions were observed in the BCDCV-inoculated poults. The lesions did not differ significantly with whether they were fed or fasted. The severity of the lesions in the intestinal epithelium was in decreasing order in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum. The lesions first appeared 24 hours postinoculation (PI) and progressed through 96 hours PI, as marked shortening of the villi, loss of microvilli, granular appearance of the cytoplasm of epithelial cells with nuclear margination of chromatin, and accentuation of the nucleolus. Similar lesions were observed in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum of turkey embryos inoculated at 24 days old as well as poults from these embryos. Signs of healing were first seen at 120 hours PI. No histopathological changes were observed in the pancreas, brain, kidneys, liver, adrenal, and bursa of Fabricius. The intestinal lesions observed should be a useful histological technique for differentiating fasting from bluecomb disease in turkey poults.},
