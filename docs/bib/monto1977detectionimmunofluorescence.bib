    abstract = {An indirect fluorescent antibody technique has been developed for use with coronaviruses 229E and OC43. For the former virus, WI-38 cells were used as the host system, and for the latter LLC-MK2 cells were employed. Human serum pairs which were known to show a rise in antibody titer by other serologic techniques were tested by the FA method. Comparison of results obtained by different procedures showed that FA was specific and would be a useful addition to available methods for identifying infection serologically. },
