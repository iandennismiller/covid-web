    abstract = {Human coronavirus (HCoV) strain 229E infection, but not HCoV strain OC43 infection, of monocytes/macrophages from healthy donors and patients with multiple sclerosis in remission resulted in increased apoptosis, as measured by DNA changes and annexin V staining. Apoptosis correlated with the differential release of infectious virus. HCoV strain 229E titers were 103.5 to 106 50% tissue culture-infective doses (TCID50)/ml, and HCoV strain OC43 titers were only 101.2 to 102.7 TCID50/ml.},
