    abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first occurred in southern China at the end of 2002 and has caused more than 8000 illnesses in total with over 700 fatalities as of end of August 2003. A unique collaborative effort, led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and uniting several laboratories from around the world, allowed the identification of the causative agent within only one month. It is a hitherto unknown novel coronavirus (provisionally termed SARS-associated coronavirus or SARS-CoV) that fulfills Koch's postulates. The virus is easily propagated in cell culture (under suitable high-security laboratory conditions) which should facilitate further studies into its stability as well as the development of antivirally active substances and vaccines. Although diagnostic laboratory tests, particularly for the detection of viral nucleic acid and virus-specific antibodies, were quickly available, the case definition for SARS continues to be based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. In view of the threat of a (seasonal) recurrence of the infection it is urgently necessary to evaluate and to further improve the available laboratory methods. SARS is a good example of how rapidly an infectious disease may spread through international travel activities; but it also demonstrates the importance of a well-coordinated international cooperation in such a case. Through the use of the latest advances together with more traditional laboratory methods and the constant exchange of (interim) results, patient samples and reagents, an unprecedented collaborative effort soon achieved a breakthrough. This should provide encouragement in the struggle against other novel infectious agents.},
