    abstract = {© 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien. Equine coronavirus has been responsible for several outbreaks of disease in the United States and Japan. Only one complete genome sequence (NC99 isolated in the US) had been reported for this pathogenic RNA virus. Here, we report the complete genome sequences of three equine coronaviruses isolated in 2009 and 2012 in Japan. The genome sequences of Tokachi09, Obihiro12-1 and Obihiro12-2 were 30,782, 30,916 and 30,916 nucleotides in length, respectively, excluding the 3’-poly (A) tails. All three isolates were genetically similar to NC99 (98.2–98.7 %), but deletions and insertions were observed in the genes nsp3 of ORF1a, NS2 and p4.7.},
