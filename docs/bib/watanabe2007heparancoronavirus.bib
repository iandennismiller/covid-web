    abstract = {A highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHMV strain (wt) with receptor (MHVR)-independent infection activity and its low-virulent mutant srr7 without such activity were found to attach to MHVR-negative, non-permissive BHK cells. To identify the molecule that interacts with JHMV, we focused on heparan sulfate (HS) since it works as a receptor of a mutant MHV-rec1 that infects in an MHVR-independent fashion. The present study indicates that HS interacts with both wt JHMV and srr7 but it does not function as an entry receptor as it apparently does for MHV-rec1. Furthermore, HS failed to serve as an entry receptor in the MHVR-independent infection of wt JHMV, indicating that HS is not a host factor that wt JHMV utilizes in an MHVR-independent infection.
