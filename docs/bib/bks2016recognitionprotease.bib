    abstract = {© 2016 Elsevier Inc. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) recognize and cleave linkage-specific polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains, but mechanisms underlying specificity remain elusive in many cases. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) is a DUB that cleaves ISG15, a two-domain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUb. Lys48 products. To elucidate this specificity, we report the 2.85 Å crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUb. Lys48 activity-based probe. SARS PLpro binds diUb. Lys48 in an extended conformation via two contact sites, S1 and S2, which are proximal and distal to the active site, respectively. We show that specificity for polyUb. Lys48 chains is predicated on contacts in the S2 site and enhanced by an S1-S1' preference for a Lys48 linkage across the active site. In contrast, ISG15 specificity is dominated by contacts in the S1 site. Determinants revealed for polyUb. Lys48 specificity should prove useful in understanding PLpro deubiquitinating activities in coronavirus infections. Békés et al. present a high-resolution crystal structure of a SARS virus PLpro~diUb. Lys48 complex that reveals an extended conformation of the Lys48-linked diUb unit and shows the biochemical basis for SARS PLpro's preference for Lys48-linked polyUb chains.},
