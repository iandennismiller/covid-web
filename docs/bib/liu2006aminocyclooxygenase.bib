    abstract = {The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). To evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in the viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of SARS-CoV Spike (S) protein in the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Expression of COX-2 stimulated by the S protein was verified by RT-PCR and western blot assay. To explore the relationship between S and COX-2, we constructed a series of plasmids containing truncated N-terminal fragments of the SARS-CoV S gene (designated from Sa to Si), which encoded truncated S proteins, and investigated whether these truncated proteins could induce effective expression of COX-2 in 293T cells. Our results showed that S d that encoded a truncated S protein with 422 amino acid residues (from 1 to 422 aa), a part of 672 amino-acid S1 subunit is crucial for the induction of COX-2 expression. Immunofluorescence examinations also give the evidence that these N terminal 422 amino acids of the S protein were also required for the correct localization of the protein. We also compared S protein sequences of SARS-CoV isolated during the SARS break with that from palm civets, a possible source of SARS-CoV found in humans. S protein residues (344, 360), which mutated in the epitome from palm civet to human being were characterized in 3D modeling of 252-375 amino acid fragment. Collectively, these results indicate that S protein of SARS-CoV induces the expression of COX-2 and an N-terminal fragment of the Spike protein is crucial for the induction. Our finding may provide clue for the induction of inflammation by SARS-CoV and cast insight into the severity of the SARS epidemic. Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.},
