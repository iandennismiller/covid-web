    abstract = {To investigate whether genetic factors of innate immunity might influence susceptibility and/or progression in individuals infected with SARS, we evaluated the CD14 gene polymorphism in 198 Hong Kong blood donors and 152 Hong Kong severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients who were previously genotyped for FcγRIIA polymorphisms. The prevalence of the CD14-159CC polymorphism was significantly higher in the patients with severe SARS than in the those with mild SARS or controls (31% versus 15% [mild SARS] or 20% [controls]; mild SARS: P = 0.029; odds ratio, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 6.57; controls, P = 0.04; odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 5.54), and both CD14-159CC and FcγRIIA-RR131 are risk genotypes for severe SARS-CoV infection.
