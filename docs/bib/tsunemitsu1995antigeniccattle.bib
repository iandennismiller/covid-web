    abstract = {The antigenic and biological properties of 6 strains of bovine coronavirus (BCV) derived from neonatal calf diarrhea (CD) and 8 strains of BCV from winter dysentery (WD) of adult cattle, propagated in HRT-18 cells, were compared to determine if CD and WD strains belong to distinct serotypes or subtypes of BCV. All strains hemagglutinated both mouse and chicken erythrocytes at 4 °C, but the ratios of hemagglutination titers with mouse erythrocytes compared to chicken erythrocytes showed diversity for both CD and WD strains. Some CD and WD strains did not hemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 37 °C and showed receptor-destroying enzyme activity against chicken erythrocytes. Hyperimmune antisera were produced in guinea pigs against 3 and 7 strains of BCV from CD and WD, respectively. No significant differences in antibody titers against these strains were observed by indirect immunofluorescence tests. However, in virus neutralization tests, antisera to 1 CD and 2 WD strains had 16-fold or lower antibody titers against 3 WD and 1 CD strains than against the homologous strains, and this variation reflected low antigenic relatedness values (R=13-25%), suggesting the presence of different subtypes among BCV. In hemagglutination inhibition tests, some one-way antigenic variations among strains were also observed. These results suggest that some antigenic and biological diversity exists among BCV strains, but these variations were unrelated to the clinical source of the strains; i.e. CD or WD. },
