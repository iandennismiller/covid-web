    abstract = {We report the complete genome sequences of five human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) strains obtained using next-generation sequencing. The five HCoV-NL63 strains were obtained from hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infection detected in Guangdong, China. This study provides several complete genomes of HCoV-NL63 and improves our understanding of HCoV-NL63 evolution in China.},
