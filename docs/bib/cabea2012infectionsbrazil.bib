    abstract = {The incidence and clinical features of human coronaviruses (HCo. Vs) among Brazilian patients with respiratory illness are not well known. We investigated the prevalence of HCo. Vs among Brazilian outpatients and hospitalised patients with respiratory illnesses during 2009 and 2010. To identify the HCo. Vs, pancoronavirus and species-specific reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays were performed. Five of 394 samples were positive for HCo. Vs (1.2%): 1/182 (0.5%) outpatients and 4/212 (1.8%) hospitalised patients. The OC43 and NL63 HCo. Vs were identified. Two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. Underlying chronic disease was reported in cases and one diabetic adult died. HCo. Vs can cause lower respiratory infections and hospitalisation. Patients with pre-existing conditions and respiratory infections should be evaluated for HCoV infections.},
