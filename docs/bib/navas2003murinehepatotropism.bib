    abstract = {Recombinant murine coronaviruses, differing only in the spike gene and containing the strain A59 (moderately hepatotropic) and JHM (neurotropic) spike genes in the background of the JHM genome, were compared for the ability to replicate in the liver and induce hepatitis in weanling C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, expression of the A59 spike glycoprotein within the background of the neurotropic JHM strain does not reproduce the A59 hepatotropic phenotype. Thus, the JHM genetic background plays a dominant role over the spike in the determination of hepatotropism.},
