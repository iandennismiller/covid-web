    abstract = {Background/Purpose: An epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Taiwan from April to July 2003. A nosocomial outbreak of SARS occurred at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in May 2003. The purpose of our study was to survey the prevalence of the SARS coronavirus (CoV) in a community adjacent to Kaohsiung CGMH and collect demographic data, including basic information about health status, household, and possible risk factors for SARS-CoV infection. Methods: We randomly recruited 1030 persons living in three precincts adjacent to Kaohsiung CGMH. For all subjects, we collected demographic data and measured the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: The ELISA was seropositive for 124 of 1030 participants (12%). The more sensitive and specific IFA confirmed SARS in only two cases (0. 19%). Both confirmed cases were under 19 years of age and had no known SARS-related risk factors. Conclusion: There was low post-epidemic seroprevalence of SARS-CoV in a community adjacent to a hospital which had a nosocomial SARS outbreak. The SARS outbreak in Taiwan was primarily limited to hospital settings. Â© 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.},
