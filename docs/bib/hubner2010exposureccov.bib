    abstract = {The exposure of 13 Brazilian free-ranging nondomestic canids (five pampas fox Pseudalopex gymnocercus and eight crab-eating fox -Cerdocyon thous) from Southern region of Brazil, to Canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV) and Canine coronavirus (CCoV) was investigated. Antibodies against CDV were detected in 38.5% (5/13) of the samples. There were anti-CDV antibodies in 60% (3/5) of P. gymnocercus and in 25% (2/8) of C. thous. The frequency was higher among the adults and males. Eleven canids (84.6%) presented antibodies against CPV, 80% (4/5) were from P. gymnocercus and 87.5% (7/8) were from C. thous. There was no difference in positivity rate against CPV between gender and age. Antibodies against CCoV were detected in 38.5% (5/13) of the samples, with 60% (3/5) of positivity in P. gymnocercus and 25% (2/8) in C. thous. The frequency of antibodies against CCoV was higher among the adults and males. The study showed that these canids were exposed to CDV, CPV and CCoV.},
