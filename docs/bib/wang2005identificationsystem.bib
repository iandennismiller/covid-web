    abstract = {The Spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) plays important roles in viral pathogenesis and potentially in the development of an effective vaccine against this virulent infectious disease. In this study, the codon-optimized S gene of SARS-CoV was synthesized to construct DNA vaccine plasmids expressing either the full-length or segments of the S protein. High titer S-specific immunoglobulin G antibody responses were elicited in rabbits immunized with DNA against various segments of the S protein. Two neutralizing domains were identified on the S protein, one at the N terminus (Ser12-Thr535) and the other near the C terminus (Arg797-Ile1192).
