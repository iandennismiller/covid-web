    abstract = {In earlier studies in our laboratory, we found that bovine coronavirus (BCV) was pathogenic for 1-day-old turkey poults. This finding prompted us to study the antigenic and genomic relatedness of turkey origin coronaviruses (TOCVs) to BCV. A one-step reverse transcription (RT) - polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a 730-base pair fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of BCV and a nested PCR targeting a 407-base pair fragment of the N gene were used in an attempt to detect TOCV from North Carolina, Indiana, and a prototype turkey coronavirus (TCV) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Both the one-step RT-PCR and the nested PCR amplified cell culture - passaged isolates of calf diarrhea strains of BCV but none of the 15 tested TOCVs or transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of swine. TOCVs also did not cross-react in a BCV antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against N, spike glycoprotein, and hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein proteins of BCV as coating antibodies. The same TOCVs could be detected with primers designed from the genome of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens. These primers amplified a 1082-base pair region spanning portions of the membrane glycoprotein (M) and N protein genes of IBV and TCV. The TOCVs also cross-reacted in an AC-ELISA with MAbs against the M and subunit 2 of spike glycoprotein of IBV.},
