    abstract = {The porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line, IPEC-J2, is useful to characterize the interactions of enterocytes with enteric viruses in vitro. We investigated whether IPEC-J2 cells are susceptible to porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection. We conducted quantification of infectious virus or viral RNA, immunofluorescent (IF) staining for the detection of PDCoV antigens, and TUNEL assay in IPEC-J2 cells inoculated with the strain OH-FD22-P8 grown in LLC-PK cells, and supplemented with 10 μg/ml of trypsin in the cell culture medium. Cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged and rounded cells followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, were identified by the 3rd viral passage in the IPEC-J2 cells. PDCoV antigen was detected in the cells showing CPE. By double IF and TUNEL staining, most PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells failed to show TUNEL-positive signals, indicating that PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells may not undergo apoptosis, but rather necrosis, similar to necrotic cell death of infected enterocytes in vivo. There was increased interleukin-6 in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cell culture supernatants at post-inoculation hour (PIH) 48–96, as evaluated by ELISA, concurrent with increased titers of PDCoV at PIH 24–72. The susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection supports their usefulness to characterize the interactions of enterocytes with PDCoV. We also demonstrated that IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) was enteropathogenic in 10-day-old gnotobiotic pigs, and induced systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during the acute PDCoV infection.},
