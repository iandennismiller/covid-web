    abstract = {Â© 2019 American Society for Microbiology. We identified a strain of betacoronavirus BtKY72/Rhinolophus sp./Kenya/ 2007 (here BtKY72) from rectal swab samples in Kenyan bats. This paper reports the complete genomic sequence of BtKY72, which is closely related to Bt. CoV/BM48-31/ Bulgaria/2008, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related virus from Rhinolophus bats in Europe.},
