    abstract = {Â© American Roentgen Ray Society. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe the chest CT findings in seven patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. CONCLUSION. The most common CT finding in hospitalized patients with MERS-CoV infection is that of bilateral predominantly subpleural and basilar airspace changes, with more extensive ground-glass opacities than consolidation. The subpleural and peribronchovascular predilection of the abnormalities is suggestive of an organizing pneumonia pattern.},
