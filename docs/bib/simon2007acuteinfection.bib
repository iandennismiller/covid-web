    abstract = {In this short report we discuss the temporal association between an acute life threatening event (ALTE) and a RT-PCR confirmed coronavirus HCoV-229E infection in a 4 months old otherwise healthy infant. More detailed microbiological investigations of affected children even without apparent signs of a respiratory tract infection may help to clarify the etiology in some patients and extend our understanding of the pathogenesis. PCR-based techniques should be utilized to increase the sensitivity of detection for old and new respiratory viral pathogens in comparable cases. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
