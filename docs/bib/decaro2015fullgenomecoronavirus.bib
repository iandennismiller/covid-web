    abstract = {Â© 2015 Decaro et al. Pantropic canine coronavirus (CCoV) was first detected in young dogs in Italy in 2005, but the complete genome sequence of this virus had not yet been determined. Here, we report the full-length genome sequence of the prototype strain CB/05, which showed that this virus is genetically similar to CCoV-IIa viruses.},
