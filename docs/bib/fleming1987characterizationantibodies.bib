    abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies reacting with the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) were characterized and those specific to the E2 major envelope glycoprotein were studied in detail. Antibodies were tested for their ability to neutralize viral infectivity (N+ characteristic) and prevent viral-induced cell-to-cell fusion (F+ characteristic). All four possible combinations of activities reflecting E2 functions were found, i.e., N+F+, N−F−, N+F−, and N−F+. In addition, competitive binding studies with these monoclonal antibodies revealed two nonoverlapping antigenic regions. The first region, designated A, was recognized by antibodies which included each of the four functional types. Region B was identified by a single monoclonal antibody with N−F− activities. The existence of antibodies which only neutralize virus or only block viral-induced fusion implies that the structures on E2 which serve as targets for neutralization and which induce fusion are not identical. The critical determinants for neutralization and fusion must be closely related topographically on E2 since both N+F− and N−F+ antibodies recognize the same antigenic region. },
