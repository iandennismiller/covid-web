    abstract = {The present study is undertaken to investigate the immune response that was induced by the recombinant spike (S) protein from swine-transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) expressed in mouse mammary cells. A mammary-specific expression vector pEBS containing the full-length cDNA of S gene was constructed and expressed in the mouse mammary cells (EMT6). The recombinant S protein from culture supernatant of transgenic EMT6 was harvested and immunized BALB/c mice. The results demonstrated recombinant S protein was expressed at high levels in mammary cells by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection. The antibody titer in BALB/c mice following immunization with recombinant S protein was detectable after the first immunization. Maximum titers of antibody (8.86 ± 0.19 ng/ml of serum) were attained after the second immunization. In conclusion, the recombinant S protein expressed in mammary cells was able to elicit substantial immunological response against TGEV. This lays the basis for using mammary gland bioreactor generating edible vaccine. © 2007.},
