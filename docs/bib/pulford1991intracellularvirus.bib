    abstract = {The Spike (S) protein from a virulent British field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) FS772/70 was constructed from cDNA and inserted into the vaccinia virus (VV) thymidine kinase gene locus under the control of the VV early/late gene P7.5K promoter. Recombinant S protein was synthesized as an endo-β-N-acetylglucosamini-dase H (Endo H)-sensitive glycoprotein with high mannose simple oligosaccharides (gp190) that underwent post-translational modification to an Endo H-resistant glycoprotein with complex oligosaccharides (gp210). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the majority of recombinant S protein was retained at the Golgi but some S protein was expressed on the plasma membrane. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against native S protein reacted with this recombinant S protein; also, mice infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing the S protein induced TGEV neutralizing antibodies. A truncated S protein (SΔ) was also expressed in rVV-infected cells by introducing a deletion into the S protein cDNA that removed 292 amino acids from the C-terminus. The SΔ protein (gpl70) was shown to be antigenically similar to TGEV S protein by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation tests but was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and not expressed on the cell surface. © 1991.},
