    abstract = {Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is an alternate mechanism of translation used by coronavirus to synthesize replication proteins encoded by two overlapping open reading frames. For some coronaviruses, the mRNA cis-acting stimulatory structures involved in this process have been characterized, but their precise contribution to ribosomal frameshifting is not completely understood. Recently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. This review describes the mRNA motifs involved in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in this virus.},
