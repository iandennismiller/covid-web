    abstract = {We have identified nine intracellular virus-specific proteins in cells infected with JHMV or A59V. Seven virus-specific proteins were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two additional virus-specific proteins were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The A59V- and JHMV-specific proteins differ slightly in molecular weight. Four of the nine proteins are structural proteins. The synthesis of the nine virus-specific proteins is noncoordinate with respect to time. Â© 1979.},
