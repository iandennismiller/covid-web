    abstract = {Bat SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) has a genome organization almost identical to that of SARS-CoV, but the N-terminus of the Spike (S) proteins, which interacts with host receptor and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies against Co. Vs, of the two viruses has only 63-64% sequence identity. Although there have been reports studying the overall immunogenicity of S Sl, knowledge on the precise location of immunodominant determinants for SSl is still lacking. In this study, using a series of truncated expressed SSl fragments and SSl specific mouse sera, we identified two immunogenic determinants for SSl. Importantly, one of the two regions seems to be located in a region not shared by known immunogenic determinants of the SSars-This finding will be of potential use in future monitoring of SL-CoV infection in bats and spillover animals and in development of more effective vaccine to cover broad protection against this new group of coronaviruses.
