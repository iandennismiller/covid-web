    abstract = {This study used a sensitive polymerase chain reaction method coupled with filter sampling to detect the presence of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in an isolation patient room with a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome receiving mechanical ventilatory support. Polymerase chain reaction results were negative for SARS coronavirus in room air both before and after patient extubation. Â© 2006 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. },
