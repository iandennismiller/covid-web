    abstract = {We investigated the clinical impact of human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) during routine and exacerbation visits. A total of 408 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were obtained from 103 patients over a 1-year period. Samples positive for HCoV were submitted for nucleotide sequencing to determine the species. Nineteen samples (4.65%) were positive for HCoV, of which 8 were positive for NL63, 6 for OC43, 4 for HKU1, and 1 for 229E. Identification of HCoV was not associated with an increased rate of respiratory exacerbations, but NL63-positive patients had higher exacerbation rates than patients who were positive for other HCoV species. © 2012 The Author.},
