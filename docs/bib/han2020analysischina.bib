    abstract = {An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spreads rapidly worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused mildly to seriously and fatally respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In this study, we detected and analyzed the main laboratory indicators related to heart injury, CK-MB, MYO, ultra-TnI and NT-proBNP, in 273 COVID-19 patients and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease. It was found that higher concentration in venous blood of CK-MB, MYO, ultra-TnI and NT-proBNP were associated with the severity and case-fatality rate of COVID-19. Careful monitoring of the myocardiac enzyme profiles is of great importance in reducing the complications and mortality in COVID-19 patients. This article is protected by copyright. },
