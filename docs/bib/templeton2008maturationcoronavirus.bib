    abstract = {Macrophages and microglia are critical in the acute inflammatory response and act as final effector cells of demyelination during chronic infection with the neutrotropic MHV-JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM). Herein, we show that "immature" F4/80+Ly-6Chi monocytes are the first cells, along with neutrophils, to enter the MHV-JHM-infected central nervous system (CNS). As the infection progresses, macrophages in the CNS down-regulate expression of Ly-6C and CD62L, consistent with maturation, and a higher frequency express CD11c, a marker for dendritic cells (DCs). Microglia also express CD11c during this phase of the infection. CD11c+ macrophages in the infected CNS exhibit variable properties of immature antigen-presenting cells (APCs), with modestly increased CD40 and MHC expression, and equivalent potent antigen uptake when compared with CD11c - macrophages. Furthermore, CDllc+ and F4/80+ macrophages and microglia are localized to areas of demyelination, in some instances directly associated with damaged axons. These results suggest that chronic CNS infection results in the appearance of CD11c-expressing macrophages from the blood that exhibit properties of immature APCs, are closely associated with areas of demyelination, and may act as final effectors of myelin destruction. },
