    abstract = {A new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based immunoglobulin G (IgG)-plus-IgM antibody detection test for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been developed by using a cocktail of four recombinant polypeptides as the antigen. These recombinant fragments were designed as parts of two different structural proteins from SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). One recombinant polypeptide, S251-683, was designed as part of the spike glycoprotein, and the other three polypeptides comprised almost the whole nucleocapsid protein, avoiding the last 25 C-terminal amino acids. Immunization with a cocktail of these four polypeptides yielded a specific polyclonal antibody that is able to recognize SARS-CoV-infected cells by an immunofluorescence assay. This polypeptide cocktail was also used to set up an ELISA-based IgG-plus-IgM antibody detection test, which showed 99% specificity and 90% sensitivity upon evaluation using sera from 100 healthy negative controls and 20 SARS patients. Separate immunoreactivity assays with each recombinant polypeptide demonstrated that a combination of N and S protein fragments was more suitable than the individual peptides for developing a serological assay for SARS-CoV.
