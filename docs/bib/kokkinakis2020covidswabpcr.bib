    abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic imposes new diagnostic strategies in order to optimize the medical care of our patients. The current biblio-graphy, although of low quality, shows a sensitivity of 56 to 83 % for the Covid-19 PCR. Even though one negative test can exclude a Covid-19 in the majority of cases, the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) decreases with increasing prevalence (pre-test probability). This finding suggests the need for strict auto-isolation of patients until the resolution of their symptoms. For patients that present with typical symptoms, who have a presumed Covid-19 prevalence of -40-50 %, a negative test should be interpreted with caution and a repeat test may be needed.},
