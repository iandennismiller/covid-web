    abstract = {SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has recently been identified as the causative agent of SARS. We constructed a series of recombinant DIs (rDIs), a highly attenuated vaccinia strain, expressing a gene encoding four structural proteins (E, M, N and S) of SARS-CoV individually or simultaneously. These rDIs elicited SARS-CoV-specific serum IgG antibody and T-cell responses in vaccinated mice following intranasal or subcutaneous administration. Mice that were subcutaneously vaccinated with rDIs expressing S protein with or without other structural proteins induced a high level of serum neutralizing IgG antibodies and demonstrated marked protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in the absence of a mucosal IgA response. These results indicate that the potent immune response elicited by subcutaneous injection of rDIs containing S is able to control mucosal infection by SARS-CoV. Thus, replication-deficient DIs constructs hold promise for the development of a safe and potent SARS vaccine. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc. },
