    abstract = {Various infections in the central nervous system (CNS) trigger B cell accumulation; however, the relative dynamics between viral replication and alterations in distinct B cell subsets are largely unknown. Using a glia-tropic coronavirus infection, which is initiated in the brain but rapidly spreads to and predominantly persists in the spinal cord, this study characterizes longitudinal changes in B cell subsets at both infected anatomical sites. The phase of T cell-dependent, antibody-independent control of infectious virus was associated with a similar recruitment of naive/early-activated IgD+ IgM+ B cells into both the brain and spinal cord. This population was progressively replaced by CD138- IgD- IgM+ B cells, isotype-switched CD138- IgD- IgM- memory B cells (Bmem), and CD138+ antibody-secreting cells (ASC). A more rapid transition to Bmem and ASC in spinal cord than in brain was associated with higher levels of persisting viral RNA and transcripts encoding factors promoting B cell migration, differentiation, and survival. The results demonstrate that naive/early-activated B cells are recruited early during coronavirus CNS infection but are subsequently replaced by more differentiated B cells. Furthermore, viral persistence, even at low levels, is a driving force for accumulation of isotype-switched Bmem and ASC. Â© 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},
