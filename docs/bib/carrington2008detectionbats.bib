    abstract = {Bat coronaviruses (Bt-Co. Vs) are thought to be the precursors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We detected Bt-Co. Vs in 2 bat species from Trinidad. Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and helicase confirmed them as group 1 coronaviruses.},
