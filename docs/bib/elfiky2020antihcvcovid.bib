    abstract = {AIMS: A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19). Until today >2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for >8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Rd. Rp). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 Rd. Rp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV Rd. Rp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. KEY FINDINGS: The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 Rd. Rp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs. Besides, the study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly emerged viral infection.},
