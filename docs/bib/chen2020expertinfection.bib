    abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide clinical management guidelines for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in pregnancy. METHODS: On February 5, 2020, a multidisciplinary teleconference comprising Chinese physicians and researchers was held and medical management strategies of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy were discussed. RESULTS: Ten key recommendations were provided for the management of COVID-19 infections in pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is no clear evidence regarding optimal delivery timing, the safety of vaginal delivery, or whether cesarean delivery prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery; therefore, route of delivery and delivery timing should be individualized based on obstetrical indications and maternal-fetal status.},
