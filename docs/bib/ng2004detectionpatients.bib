    abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has caused major outbreaks worldwide, resulting in an urgent need to obtain sensitive and accurate diagnosis of this disease. PCR-based detection methods were developed for use on a variety of samples, including blood. Eighteen subjects were investigated, and results indicated that blood samples contain sufficient virus for detection by using quantitative real-time PCR.},
