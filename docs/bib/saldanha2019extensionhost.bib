    abstract = {© The Author(s) 2019. Disease surveillance in wildlife populations presents a logistical challenge, yet is critical in gaining a deeper understanding of the presence and impact of wildlife pathogens. Erinaceus coronavirus (Eri. CoV), a clade C Betacoronavirus, was first described in Western European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in Germany. Here, our objective was to determine whether Eri. CoV is present, and if it is associated with disease, in Great Britain (GB). An Eri. CoV-specific BRYT-Green® real-time reverse transcription PCR assay was used to test 351 samples of faeces or distal large intestinal tract contents collected from casualty or dead hedgehogs from a wide area across GB. Viral RNA was detected in 10.8% (38) samples; however, the virus was not detected in any of the 61 samples tested from Scotland. The full genome sequence of the British Eri. CoV strain was determined using next generation sequencing; it shared 94% identity with a German Eri. CoV sequence. Multivariate statistical models using hedgehog case history data, faecal specimen descriptions and post-mortem examination findings found no significant associations indicative of disease associated with Eri. CoV in hedgehogs. These findings indicate that the Western European hedgehog is a reservoir host of Eri. CoV in the absence of apparent disease.},
