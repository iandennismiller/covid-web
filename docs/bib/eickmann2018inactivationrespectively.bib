    abstract = {© 2018 AABBBACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been identified as potential threats to blood safety. This study investigated the efficacy of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma pathogen inactivation systems to inactivate EBOV and MERS-CoV in platelet concentrates (PCs) and plasma, respectively. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PCs and plasma were spiked with high titers of cell culture–derived EBOV and MERS-CoV, treated with various light doses of ultraviolet C (UVC; THERAFLEX UV-Platelets) or methylene blue (MB) plus visible light (MB/light; THERAFLEX MB-Plasma), and assessed for residual viral infectivity. RESULTS: UVC reduced EBOV (≥4.5 log) and MERS-CoV (≥3.7 log) infectivity in PCs to the limit of detection, and MB/light decreased EBOV (≥4.6 log) and MERS-CoV (≥3.3 log) titers in plasma to nondetectable levels. CONCLUSIONS: Both THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (UVC) and THERAFLEX MB-Plasma (MB/light) effectively reduce EBOV and MERS-CoV infectivity in platelets and plasma, respectively.},
