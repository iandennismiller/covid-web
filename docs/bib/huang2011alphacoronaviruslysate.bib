    abstract = {The nsp1 protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an alphacoronavirus, efficiently suppressed protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Unlike the nsp1 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a betacoronavirus, the TGEV nsp1 protein was unable to bind 40S ribosomal subunits or promote host mRNA degradation. TGEV nsp1 also suppressed protein translation in cell-free He. La cell extract; however, it did not affect translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Our data suggested that He. La cell extracts and cultured host cells, but not RRL, contain a host factor(s) that is essential for TGEV nsp1-induced translational suppression.
