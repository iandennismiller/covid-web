    abstract = {Serum and CSF specimens from clinically healthy Brown Norway (BN) rats inoculated intracerebrally with corona virus JHM were analysed with respect to the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intrathecal synthesis and isoelectric distribution of immunoglobulins (Ig). Increased CSF/serum ratios for Ig in the context of an intact BBB were never seen in the absence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies. Affinity-mediated immunoblot analysis revealed a broad pattern of virus-specific antibodies with embedded clusters of restricted heterogeneity, but no signs of oligoclonal Ig production carrying non-viral specificity. From these data it was concluded that BN rats do control the intracerebral spread of JHM virus effectively by a strong local virus-specific antibody response, thereby preventing a clinically apparent disease. © 1987.},
