    abstract = {Â© 2017 Suzuki et al. In 2016, an outbreak of diarrhea with high mortality in piglets occurred on a swine farm in Hokkaido prefecture, Japan. The causative porcine deltacoronavirus HDK/JPN/2016 was isolated from intestinal samples of the dead piglets on LLCPK1 cells. The complete genome of HKD/JPN/2016 was sequenced and analyzed by next-generation sequencing technology.},
