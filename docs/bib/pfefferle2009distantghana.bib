    abstract = {We tested 12 bat species in Ghana for coronavirus (CoV) RNA. The virus prevalence in insectivorous bats (n = 123) was 9.76%. CoV was not detected in 212 fecal samples from Eidolon helvum fruit bats. Leaf-nosed bats pertaining to Hipposideros ruber by morphology had group 1 and group 2 Co. Vs. Virus concentrations were ≤45,000 copies/100 mg of bat feces. The diversified group 1 CoV shared a common ancestor with the human common cold virus hCoV-229E but not with hCoV-NL63, disputing hypotheses of common human descent. The most recent common ancestor of hCoV-229E and Ghana. Bt-CoVGrp1 existed in ∼1686-1800 ad. The Ghana. Bt-CoVGrp2 shared an old ancestor (∼2,400 years) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-like group of CoV.},
