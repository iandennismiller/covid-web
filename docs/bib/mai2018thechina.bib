    abstract = {Â© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbHPorcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly discovered coronavirus that causes diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in sucking and nursing piglets. It was first reported in Hong Kong in 2012 and has since been discovered in the United States, Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand and Laos. PDCoV has been experimentally proved to lead to diarrhoea in swine and it was detected positive in pigs in Guangdong, southern China. In our study, 252 faecal and intestinal samples from sucking piglets and sows with diarrhoea were surveyed for common enteric viruses. We found a prevalence of PDCoV (21.8%), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (65.5%), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (0%), rotavirus group A (25.0%) and porcine kobuvirus (68.7%). We isolated 13 PDCoV strains and discovered that PDCoV infections were often co-infections with kobuvirus rather than the commonly linked porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus. Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and N gene revealed that 11 of 13 PDCoV strains belonged to Chinese lineage. As for the left two strains, one single strain (CHN-GD16-05) belonged to American and Korean lineages while another strain (CHN-GD16-03) was similar to a Thai strain, but only in the S gene. This suggested a possible recombination event between the Thai and the newly described Chinese strain.},
