    abstract = {The morphology of three coronaviruses; avian infectious bronchitis virus strain Connecticut (IBV Conn), human coronavirus strain 229E (HCV 229E) and mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV3), were examined by negative staining. Significant differences were found in the sizes of the three coronaviruses. Furthermore, three types of surface projection of the same lengths, but varying widths and morphology, were observed. Both IBV Conn and HCV 229E had bulbous projections characteristic of coronaviruses, although the projections of HCV 229E were somewhat thinner than those of IBV Conn. On the other hand, MHV3 particles had thin, cone-shaped surface projections, that were completely unlike typical coronavirus projections. The significance of these results is discussed. },
