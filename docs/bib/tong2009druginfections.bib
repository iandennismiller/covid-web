    abstract = {Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens of the order Nidovirales. Several new members were discovered following the emergence of SARS-CoV in human populations, including two human coronaviruses and several animal coronaviruses. They cause respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses and have been found in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis. The high mortality of SARS, the identification of a natural reservoir, and the well-founded fear of provoking antibody-enhanced disease as a result of vaccination fueled the ongoing efforts in anti-coronavirus drug discovery. This review presents the results of current research. Â© 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},
