    abstract = {Since December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has spread from China to other countries. In order to effectively respond to possible neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, neonatologists from the Medical Association of Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics proposed the response plan in the neonatal intensive care unit during epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection (1st edition) at the end of January of 2020. Based on the further knowledge and experience on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the neonatologists updated the plan according to the current evidence, so as to provide a better guide for clinical medical staff to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the NICU.},
