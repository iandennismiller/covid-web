    abstract = {Virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants, heating and ultraviolet radiation against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), canine coronavirus (CCV), Kilham rat virus (KRV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) were examined. Coronaviruses (MHV and CCV) were inactivated by ethanol, isopropanol, benzalkonium chloride, iodophor, sodium hypochlorite, sodium chlorite, cresol soap and formaldehyde as well as by heating at 60 degrees C for 15 minutes, whereas parvoviruses (KRV and CPV) appeared to be inactivated by disinfectants such as formaldehyde, iodophor, sodium hypochlorite and sodium chlorite. Parvoviruses were stable under heating of up to 80 degrees C for 30 minutes. Ultraviolet radiation inactivated all viruses within 15 minutes. No significant differences in stability against physico-chemical treatments were seen between viruses in the same group.},
