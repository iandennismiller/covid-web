    abstract = {Â© 2016. Bovine coronavirus infections in adult cattle are commonly referred as to winter dysentery and present as an epidemic outbreak characterised by the sudden onset of diarrhoea with fresh blood that presents with high morbidity but low mortality. Despite the low mortality, milk production may not return fully to expected levels until several weeks post infection. This case report demonstrates the symptoms, examination and evaluation of a referred outbreak of winter dysentery in adult and youngstock cattle in a dairy herd located in northwestern Spain, highlighting the importance of precise questioning and on-farm assessment for examining the biocontainment practices of a herd.},
