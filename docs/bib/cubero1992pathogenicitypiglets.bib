    abstract = {We compared the pathogenicity and the sites of multiplication of the attenuated Nouzilly strain, with the highly passaged Purdue-115 and the virulent Gep II strains of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, in 1-week-old weaned piglets. The immunohistochemical peroxidase technique, with an antiviral nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody, was used for the localization of the multiplication sites, in the intestine and other organs. The Gep II and the Purdue-115 strains, administered orally to piglets, caused clinical signs and lesions of TGE. These strains multiplied within the intestinal tract in the enterocytes of the jejunum and ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. In view of the small numbers of infected cells in the tonsils, spleen, kidney, liver and lung, these tissues are not considered to be preferential multiplication sites. The attenuated Nouzilly strain multiplies only in the ileum and the mesenteric lymph nodes. The variation in the tropism for particular parts of the intestine (with the preferential localization of the virus in the ileum rather than the jejunum), could be related to the high degree of attenuation of the Nouzilly strain.
