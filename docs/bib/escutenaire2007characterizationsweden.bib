    abstract = {Field canine coronaviruses (CCVs) identified during a series of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Swedish dogs were subjected to genetic analysis involving the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) and the membrane (M) and spike (S) protein genes. Four field viruses originating from the Stockholm region presented identical sequences and segregated separately from other CCVs characterized so far and from GOT/05, the variant recovered in Western Sweden. A recombinant origin of the fifth virus identified in the Stockholm region is suggested. In addition, the five viruses originating from the same geographical area displayed atypical 5′ S gene sequences. },
