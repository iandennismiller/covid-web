    abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of the RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein of coronavirus MHV-A59 has heen determined. Copy DNA was prepared from mRNA isolated from virally infected cells, fragmented and cloned in the phage vector Ml 3 mp8 for direct sequence determination. A sequence of 1817 nu-cleotides, adjacent to the viral poly-A tail, was obtained. It contains a single long open reading frame encoding a protein of mol. wt. 49660, which is enriched in basic residues. Â© 1983 IRL Press Limited.},
