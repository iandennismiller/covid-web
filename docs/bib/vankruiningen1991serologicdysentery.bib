    abstract = {Acute and convalescent sera were collected from 8 dairy herds with classic clinical features of winter dysentery. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure coronavirus antibody titers, employing calf diarrhea coronavirus as antigen. Twenty-two of the 35 animals tested (63%) showed a greater than or equal to 4-fold seroconversion. Adult cattle in all 8 herds seroconverted. These findings complement previously reported immunoperoxidase and electron microscopic evidence, suggesting an etiologic role for an enteric coronavirus in this disease.},
