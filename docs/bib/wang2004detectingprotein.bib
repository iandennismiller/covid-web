    abstract = {To assess specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus, a modified DimerX flow cytometry assay was performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from HLA-A2 + SARS-recovered donors at different time points post disease. CD8 +DimerX-S1203 + CTLs were detected in the PBMC from these donors up to 3 months after recovery. The percentages of CD8 +DimerX-S1203 + cells paralleled the numbers of interferon-γ-positive spots in an ELISPOT assay using the same antigenic peptide. In conclusion, DimerX-based flow cytometry staining may prove to be a real-time method to screen for CTL directed at epitopes from a newly identified virus. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. },
