    abstract = {Rapid immunochromatographic assays for detecting infections with bovine coronavirus (BCV), rotavirus A and Cryptosporidium parvum in calf faeces were evaluated using as gold standards a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (BCV and rotavirus) and a sedimentation-flotation technique (C. parvum). Rapid tests for the detection of BCV and rotavirus showed a high specificity (96.4% and 95.3%, respectively), but a relatively low sensitivity (60.0% and 71.9%, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of C. parvum were high (100% and 94.6%, respectively). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. },
