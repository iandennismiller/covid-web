    abstract = {The family Coronavirtdae comprises a monogeneric group of 11 viruses which infect vertebrates. The main characteristics of the member viruses are: (i) Morphological: Enveloped pleomorphic particles typically 100 nm in diameter (range 60–220 nm), bearing about 20 nm long club-shaped surface projections, (ii) Structural: A single-stranded infectious molecule of genomic RNA of about (5–7) × 106 molecular weight. A phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein [mol.wt. (50–60) × 10<sup>3</sup>] complexed with the genome as a helical ribonucleoprotein; a surface (peplomer) protein, associated with one or two glycosylated polypeptides [mol.wt. (90–180) × 10<sup>3</sup>]; a transmembrane (matrix) protein, associated with one polypeptide which may be glycosylated to different degrees [mol.wt. (20–35) × 10<sup>3</sup>]. (iii) Replicative: Production in infected cells of multiple 3’ coterminal sub genomic mRNAs extending for different lengths in the 5’ direction. Virions bud intracytoplasmically. (iv) Antigenic: 3 major antigens, each corresponding to one class of virion protein, (v) Biological: Predominantly restricted to infection of natural vertebrate hosts by horizontal transmission via the fecal/oral route. Responsible mainly for respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. © 1983 S. Karger AG, Basel.},
