    abstract = {© 2019Bats are the natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the outbreak of human SARS in 2002–2003. We introduce the genetic diversity of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-Co. Vs) discovered in bats and provide insights on the bat origin of human SARS. We also analyze the viral geographical structure that may improve our understanding of the evolution of bat SARSr-Co. Vs.},
