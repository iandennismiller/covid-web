    abstract = {Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was adapted to Vero cells by serial passage. No significant inhibition of IBV replication was observed when infected Vero cells were treated with α-amanitin or actinomycin D. In thin sections of infected cells, assembly of IBV was observed at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and mature IBV particles were located in dilated cisternae of the RER as well as in smooth cytoplasmic vesicles. In addition to typical IBV particles, enveloped particles containing numerous ribosomes were identified at later times postinfection. Monensin, a sodium ionophore which blocks glycoprotein transport to plasma membranes at the level of the Golgi complex, was found to inhibit the formation of infectious IBV. In thin sections of infected Vero cells treated with the ionophore, IBV particles were located in dilated cytoplasmic vesicles, but fewer particles were found when compared to controls. A similar pattern of virus-specific proteins was detected in control or monensin-treated IBV-infected cells, which included two glycoproteins (170000 and 24000 daltons) and a polypeptide of 52000 daltons. These results suggesl lhal the ionophore inhibits assembly of a virus which malures at intracellular membranes. © 1984.},
