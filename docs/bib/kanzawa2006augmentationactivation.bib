    abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is characterized by rapidly progressing respiratory failure resembling acute/adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Here, we demonstrated that, among five accessory proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) tested, 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 were capable of activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and significantly enhanced interleukin 8 (IL-8) promoter activity. Furthermore, 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 expression in A549 cells enhanced production of inflammatory chemokines that were known to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV infection. Our results suggest potential involvement of 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 proteins in the pathological inflammatory responses in SARS. © 2006 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},
