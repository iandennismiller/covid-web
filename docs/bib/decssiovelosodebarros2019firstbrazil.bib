    abstract = {Copyright © 2019 de Barros et al. We identified a strain of Alphacoronavirus 1, FCoV-SB22, from a pool of fecal samples from domestic cats from a rural settlement in the municipality of Santa Bárbara, Pará, Brazil. The nucleotide identity with feline coronavirus was 91.5%. The present study reports the first complete genome sequence of a feline coronavirus from Brazil.},
