    abstract = {Comparative sequence analysis of the PCR products of the M gene and fragments of the pol1a and pol1b genes of canine coronavirus (CCoV) have demonstrated that two separate clusters of CCoV are present in dogs. This note describes a PCR assay to identify atypical CCoV strains with nucleotide substitutions in the M gene. A total of 177 faecal samples from dogs CCoV positive previously with the PCR assay were analysed. Sixty-two of the 177 samples were amplified with the PCR described in the present study and were thus considered atypical CCo. Vs. The specificity of the PCR typing assay was confirmed by sequence analysis of the PCR products. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. },
