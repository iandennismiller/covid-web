    abstract = {Â© 2018 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) has emerged in several pig-raising countries and has been a causative pathogen associated with diarrheal diseases in South Korea since 2014. In the present study, we were able to isolate and cultivate a Korean PDCoV strain (KNU16-07) in cell culture and investigate its pathogenicity. PDCoV-inoculated piglets showed watery diarrhea accompanied by acute enteritis in the natural host. Sequencing analysis demonstrated the genetic stability of KNU16-07 for at least thirty serial passages.},
