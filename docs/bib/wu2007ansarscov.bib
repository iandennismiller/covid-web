    abstract = {Background: The worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV. We report the use of DNAzyme (catalytic DNA) to target the 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) of a highly conserved fragment in the SARS genome as an approach to suppression of SARS-CoV replication. A mono-DNA enzyme (Dz-104) possessing the 10-23 catalytic motif was synthesized and tested both in vitro and in cell culture. Materials and methods: SARS-CoV total RNA was isolated, extracted from the SARS-CoV-WHU strain and converted into cDNA. We designed a RNA-cleaving 10-23 DNAzyme targeting at the loop region of the 5′UTR of SARS-CoV. The designed DNAzyme, Dz-104, and its mutant version, Dz-104 (mut), as a control consist of 9 + 9 arm sequences with a 10-23 catalytic core. In vitro cleavage was performed using an in vitro transcribed 5′UTR RNA substrate. A vector containing a fused 5′UTR and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was co-transfected with the DNAzyme into E6 cells and the cells expressing eGFP were visualized with fluorescence microscopy and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Results and conclusions: Our results demonstrated that this DNAzyme could efficiently cleave the SARS-CoV RNA substrate in vitro and inhibit the expression of the SARS-CoV 5′UTR-eGFP fusion RNA in mammalian cells. This work presents a model system to rapidly screen effective DNAzymes targeting SARS and provides a basis for potential therapeutic use of DNA enzymes to combat the SARS infection.
