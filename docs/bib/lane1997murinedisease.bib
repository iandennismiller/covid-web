    abstract = {A variety of neurological diseases in humans, including multiple sclerosis (MS), have been postulated to have a viral etiology. The use of animal models provides insights into potential mechanism(s) involved in the disease process. The murine coronavirus-induced demyelinating disease in rodents is one such model for demyelinating disease in humans.},
