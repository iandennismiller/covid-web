    abstract = {There has been a lot of speculation that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes. We reviewed the available evidence, and have not found this to be the case. We recommend that patients on such medications should continue on them unless there is a clinical indication to stop their use.},
