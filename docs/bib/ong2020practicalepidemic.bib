    abstract = {We read with interest the excellent Association guidelines [1] for the anaesthetic management of patients during a COVID-19 outbreak. We concur with these guidelines, which are not dissimilar to our hospital's protocols since Singapore reported its first case of COVID-19 on 23 January 2020. To date, there have been 226 confirmed cases in Singapore with no deaths reported [2]. We are preparing for many more when community transmission becomes widespread and every patient presenting for surgery becomes a potential asymptomatic infected case. We would like to highlight additional anaesthetic considerations in this COVID-19 pandemic. Our discussion is limited to patients not known to be COVID infected.},
