    abstract = {Genome RNA of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 has been used as a template to synthesize two virus-specific probes: cDNA[rep], representing the majority of sequences of the genome RNA and cDNA3, representing the 3' end of the genome RNA. Molecular hybridization with these cDNAs was used to characterize both genome RNA and intracellular virus-specific RNAs. Hybridization of genome RNAs of MHV strains A59, JHM, and MHV-3 with A59 cDNA[rep] showed that, although these three strains exhibit different pathogenicities, they contain closely related nucleotide sequences. Hybridization of intracellular RNA from MHV-infected cells with virus-specific cDNA shows that the majority of virus-specific RNA is polyadenylated, virus-specific intracellular RNA contains six subgenomic species of the same polarity as genome RNA and all subgenomic RNAs contain the same 3' sequences as the genome RNA and thus form a nested set of RNAs.},
