    abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize ds and ss probes for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) using recombinant plasmids as template molecules. The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments. © 1990.},
