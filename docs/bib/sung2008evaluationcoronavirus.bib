    abstract = {Background : Direct antigen test (DAT) and culture are primary tests to diagnose infections by respiratory viruses, but are mainly available for the traditional viral pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and adenovirus in clinical laboratories. The objective of this study was to evaluate a multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR method using Seeplex™ RV Detection kit (Seegene, Korea) for the detection of rhinovirus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Methods : From January to May 2007, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from pediatric patients negative for culture and DAT of traditional viral pathogens were tested with Seeplex™. All the amplicons were directly sequenced and homology of the sequences was searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Patients' medical records were reviewed for clinical and demographic features. Results : Forty-seven (26.4%) of 178 NPAs were positive: 18 rhinovirus, 15 hMPV, 4 RSV A, 3 coronavirus OC43, 3 influenza virus A, 2 adenovirus, 1 coronavirus NL63, and 1 RSV B. Based on maximum identity, each of the sequences indicating rhinovirus, hMPV, and coronavirus OC43 matched to the corresponding viruses with homology of 94-98%, 96-99%, and 98-100%, respectively. Seeplex™-positive patients were 0-11 yr old with a male:female ratio of 1.5:1. Clinical diagnoses included 9 pneumonia, 6 bronchiolitis, 2 cold, 1 asthma exacerbation for rhinovirus; 10 pneumonia, 4 bronchiolitis, and 1 clinical sepsis for hPMV; and 1 pneumonia, 2 croup, and 1 cold for coronavirus. Conclusions : Multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR method using Seeplex™ RV Detection kit is a reliable test to detect rhinovirus, hMPV, and coronavirus. It may improve the diagnostic sensitivity for RSV, influenza virus, PIV, and adenovirus.},
