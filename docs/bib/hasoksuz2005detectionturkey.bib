    abstract = {Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an important cause of diarrhoea in calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory tract disease in feedlot cattle. Serum, faecal and nasal swab samples were collected from a total of 96 cattle with clinical signs in 29 barns of 23 villages in Northwestern Turkey. The cattle were subdivided into 3 distinct age groups (0-30 days old, 4-12 months old and 2-7 years old). An indirect antigen-capture ELISA and an antibody-detection ELISA as well as geo-metric mean BCoV antibody titres were used to detect BoCV shed in the faeces and in the nasal secretions, respectively. Relationships between BCoV shedding and age group, seroconversion and clinical signs in cattle were also analysed. The rate of faecal shedding of BoCV was 37.1% (13/35) in 0-30 days old calves, 25.6% (10/39) in 4-12 months old feedlot cattle and 18.2% (4/22) in 2-7 years old cows. The overall rate of BCoV faecal shedding was 28.1% (27/96) in the cattle examined. Only one animal in the 4-12 months old age group was found to shed BoCV nasally. The analysis showed that there was a significant difference (P < 0.0001) with respect to faecal shedding between the clinical signs and the age groups. BCoV antibody titre in 50% of all cattle was < 100 as detected by ELISA while 27.1% of the cattle had high titres ranging between 1,600 and 25,600. The seroconversion rate was 7.3% (7/96) in animals shedding BoCV in the faeces and 42.7% (41/96) in cattle negative for faecal shedding as detected by ELISA, and 20.8% of cattle with no seroconversion shed BCoV in the faeces. There was no statistically significant association between seroconversion and nasal or faecal BCoV shedding. These findings confirm the presence of BCoV infections in Turkey. Further studies are needed to isolate BCoV strains in Turkey and to investigate their antigenic and genetic properties. © 2005 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},
