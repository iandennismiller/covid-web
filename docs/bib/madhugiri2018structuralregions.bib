    abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier Inc. Structure predictions suggest a partial conservation of RNA structure elements in coronavirus terminal genome regions. Here, we determined the structures of stem-loops (SL) 1 and 2 of two alphacoronaviruses, human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and NL63, by RNA structure probing and studied the functional relevance of these putative cis-acting elements. HCoV-229E SL1 and SL2 mutants generated by reverse genetics were used to study the effects on viral replication of single-nucleotide substitutions predicted to destabilize the SL1 and SL2 structures. The data provide conclusive evidence for the critical role of SL1 and SL2 in HCoV-229E replication and, in some cases, revealed parallels with previously characterized betacoronavirus SL1 and SL2 elements. Also, we were able to rescue viable HCoV-229E mutants carrying replacements of SL2 with equivalent betacoronavirus structural elements. The data obtained in this study reveal a remarkable degree of structural and functional conservation of 5′-terminal RNA structural elements across coronavirus genus boundaries.},
