    abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: No drugs are currently approved for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), although some have been tried. In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines. AIMS AND METHODS: We systematically searched the Pub. Med database up till March 21, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on chloroquine and HCQ and COVID-19. RESULTS: Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as experimental drugs. Since HCQ has been approved for treatment of diabetes in India, it should be further researched in diabetes and COVID-19, a subgroup where significant mortality has been shown.},
