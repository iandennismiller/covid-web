    abstract = {Â© Wildlife Disease Association 2015. Coronaviruses (Co. Vs) are worldwide in distribution, highly infectious, and difficult to control because of their extensive genetic diversity, short generation time, and high mutation rates. Genetically diverse Co. Vs have been reported from wild aquatic birds that may represent a potential reservoir for avian Co. Vs as well as hosts for mutations and recombination events leading to new serotypes or genera. We tested 133 pooled samples representing 700 first-passage (in eggs) and 303 direct cloacal swab transport media samples from wild aquatic birds in the US that were avian influenza-negative. We isolated RNA from frozen samples and performed reverse transcriptase- PCR using a published universal CoV primer set. Of the samples tested, one from a Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres) was positive for CoV, showing nucleotide sequence similarity to a duck coronavirus (DK/CH/HN/ ZZ2004). These data indicate a possible low prevalence of Co. Vs circulating in wild aquatic birds in the eastern half of the US.},
