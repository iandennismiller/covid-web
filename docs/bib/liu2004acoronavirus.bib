    abstract = {A rate equation theory to model the denaturation or replication process of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was described. The survival time of SARS coronavirus was quantified either in vitro or in vivo, through introducing thermal rate process models established from the Arrhenius law. The complex physical and chemical behaviors of the SARS virus were then attributed to its activation energy, frequency factor, damage function and the surrounding environmental conditions. It was found that survival time falls in an extremely wide range in different temperature scale. The applications of the theory to interpret several existing phenomena of the coronavirus were also discussed.},
