    abstract = {Canine distemper virus (CDV), parvovirus (CPV), adenovirus (CAV) and coronavirus (CCoV) infections have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality among dogs worldwide yet very little is known about these infections in Brazil. As to determine the prevalence of these infections in the canine population of Santa Maria, RS, Brazil, 817 blood samples were collected from non-vaccinated dogs of 14 neighborhoods and tested for specific antibodies. Antibodies to CDV were detected in 27.3% (223/817) of the samples, to CPV in 68.7% (561/817), to CAV in 43% (353/817) and to CCoV in 50.4% (412/817) of the dogs. An increase in seropositivity related to age was observed for CDV, CAV e CCoV. The seropositivity to CPV, CAV and CCoV was higher in males, while no differences between genders were observed to CDV. Higher prevalences to CDV and CCoV were observed among dogs having contact with other house or street dogs, while no differences in seropositivity were observed for CPV and CAV. These results indicate that these infections are spread out among dogs in Santa Maria. Nonetheless, a significant part of the population is still seronegative and therefore unprotected against these viruses. This indicates a need for extending the vaccination against to these viral infections.},
