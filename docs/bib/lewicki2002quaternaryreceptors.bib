    abstract = {Oligomeric spike (S) glycoproteins extend from coronavirus membranes. These integral membrane proteins assemble within the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells and are subsequently endoproteolyzed in the Golgi, generating noncovalently associated S1 and S2 fragments. Once on the surface of infected cells and virions, peripheral S1 fragments bind carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) receptors, and this triggers membrane fusion reactions mediated by integral membrane S2 fragments. We focused on the quaternary structure of S and its interaction with CEACAMs. We discovered that soluble S1 fragments were dimers and that CEACAM binding was entirely dependent on this quaternary structure. However, two differentially tagged CEACAMs could not co-precipitate with the S dimers, suggesting that binding sites were closely juxtaposed in the dimer (steric hindrance) or that a single CEACAM generated global conformational changes that precluded additional interactions (negative cooperativity). CEACAM binding did indeed alter S1 conformations, generating alternative disulfide linkages that were revealed on SDS gels. CEACAM binding also induced separation of S1 and S2. Differentially tagged S2 fragments that were free of S1 dimers were not co-precipitated, suggesting that S1 harbored the primary oligomerization determinants. We discuss the distinctions between the SÂ·CEACAM interaction and other virus-receptor complexes involved in receptor-triggered entry.},
