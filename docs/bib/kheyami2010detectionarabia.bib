    abstract = {Background: The role of coronaviruses in paediatric gastro-enteritis is not well defined. We investigated the detection rate and epidemiological features of infection with coronavirus in children receiving hospital care for acute gastro-enteritis in Maddina, Saudi Arabia. Methods: Stool specimens were collected from children less than 5 years of age who were either hospitalised in Maddina or given oral rehydration therapy as outpatients between April 2004 and April 2005. Coronaviruses were detected by electron microscopy. Results: Coronaviruses were detected in 63 (6%) of 984 children with acute gastro-enteritis and were more commonly detected in outpatients (47/423, 11%) than in inpatients (16/561, 3%). The median age (range) of children with coronavirus infection was 42 months (10-60). Coronaviruses were detected throughout the year with the highest detection rate at the end of the winter season. Conclusions: Coronaviruses were commonly identified in children with diarrhoea in Saudi Arabia. Their role in paediatric gastro-enteritis warrants further evaluation.
