    abstract = {The 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus can functionally replace its counterpart in the prototype group 2 coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). By contrast, the 3′ UTRs of representative group 1 or group 3 coronaviruses cannot operate as substitutes for the MHV 3′ UTR.},
