    abstract = {During our preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic we identified that our GE Healthcare anaesthetic machines (GE Healthcare, Amersham Place, Little Chalfont, UK) had a ventilator which was gas-driven, using oxygen. This resulted in a large amount of wasted oxygen. Our anaesthetic department has 52 anaesthetic machines which form part of our plan to increase our ITU capacity.},
