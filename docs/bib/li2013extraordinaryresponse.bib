    abstract = {A dangerous cytokine storm occurs in the SARS involving in immune disorder, but many aspects of the pathogenetic mechanism remain obscure since its outbreak. To deeply reveal the interaction of host and SARS-CoV, based on the basic structural feature of pathogen-associated molecular pattern, we created a new bioinformatics method for searching potential pathogenic molecules and identified a set of SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA fragments with a high-density distribution in the genome. . In vitro experiments, the result showed the representative SARS-CoV ssRNAs had powerful immunostimulatory activities to induce considerable level of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 release via the TLR7 and TLR8, almost 2-fold higher than the strong stimulatory ssRNA40 that was found previously from other virus. Moreover, SARS-CoV ssRNA was able to cause acute lung injury in mice with a high mortality rate . in vivo experiment. It suggests that SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA plays a very important role in the cytokine storm associated with a dysregulation of the innate immunity. This study not only presents new evidence about the immunopathologic damage caused by overactive inflammation during the SARS-CoV infection, but also provides a useful clue for a new therapeutic strategy.
