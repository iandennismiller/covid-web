    abstract = {We previously reported that replacing HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) domain with SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) residues 2-213, 215-421, or 234-421 results in efficient virus-like particle (VLP) production at a level comparable to that of wild-type HIV-1. In this study we demonstrate that these chimeras are capable of packaging large amounts of human APOBEC3G (hA3G), and that an HIV-1 Gag chimera containing the carboxyl-terminal half of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) N as a substitute for NC is capable of directing VLP assembly and efficiently packaging hA3G. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N and M (membrane) proteins, hA3G was efficiently incorporated into SARS-CoV VLPs. Data from GST pull-down assays suggest that the N sequence involved in N-hA3G interactions is located between residues 86 and 302. Like HIV-1 NC, the SARS-CoV or HCoV-229E N-associated with hA3G depends on the presence of RNA, with the first linker region essential for hA3G packaging into both HIV-1 and SARS-CoV VLPs. The results raise the possibility that hA3G is capable of associating with different species of viral structural proteins through a potentially common, RNA-mediated mechanism.
