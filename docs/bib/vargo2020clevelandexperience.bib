    abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current COVID-19 pandemic has proposed challenges to urology residency programs all over the nation, resulting in alterations in surgical volumes and academic curriculums. In this review, we propose a structured academic outline allowing for the preservation of the academic vitality. Additionally, we offer a model that optimizes resident coverage at hospitals, the preservation of surgical skills, and the designation of daily reserves as the pandemic worsens. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, there is no structured framework for urology residency programs to adhere to in the face of a global pandemic or natural disaster. Urologic surgical emergencies arise and exceptional urologic care must continue to be provided. Despite lower surgical volumes and the inability for teams to meet in person, there are still robust opportunities for urologic surgical residents and faculty to maintain their surgical skills and mental sharpness. Changes within the medical field are already beginning to take shape, especially related to telehealth and virtual learning. SUMMARY: While each urology residency program is comprised of a different number of residents and hospitals, we propose a framework which serves to maintain a urology program's academic atmosphere and surgical talent in the face of the current pandemic or future natural disaster.},
