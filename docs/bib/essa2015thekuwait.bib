    abstract = {Â© 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (Boca), human polyomavirus KI (KIV) and human polyomavirus WU (WUV) in respiratory tract infections (RTI) in Kuwait. Materials and Methods: Respiratory samples from 735 hospitalized patients with RTI from September 2010 to April 2013 were evaluated for the presence of HCoV-NL63, hMPV, Boca, KIV and WUV using molecular assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR. Results: Of the 735 patients, 285 (38.8%) were diagnosed with viral RTI. The distribution of respiratory viruses was hMPV: 15 (5.3%), Boca: 14 (4.9%), WUV: 10 (3.5%) and KIV: 4 (1.4%). HCoV-NL63 was not detected in any of the samples. Conclusions: These newly discovered viruses were associated with the development of RTI in Kuwait. The rapid identification of these viral infections could aid in the control of nosocomial transmission, reduce the use of antibiotics and improve treatment and management strategies.},
