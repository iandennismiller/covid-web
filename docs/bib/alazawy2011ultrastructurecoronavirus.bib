    abstract = {Feline coronavirus (FCoV) consists of two biotypes based on their growth in cell culture and their antigenicity. Infections with FCoV are highly prevalent in the cat population worldwide. In this study, Felis catus whole fetus (Fcwf-4)cell culture was infected with FCoV UPM11C/08. Virus multiplication in cell culture was monitored and examined under the transmission electron microscope. The virus particles revealed the characteristic morphology of feline FCoV represented by envelope viruses surrounded by peplomers. Virus attachment and entry into the cell occurred 15 h post-infection (pi), and the myriad of virus particles were observed both extracellularly and intracellularly after 48 h pi. Thereafter, intracellular virus particles were observed to be present in vacuoles or present freely in the cytoplasm. Â© The Author 2011.},
