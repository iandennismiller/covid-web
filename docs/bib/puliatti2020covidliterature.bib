Postponement for all outpatient and elective activities to save facilities and resources for urgent cases and Covid-19 patients was adopted by most of hospitals in the affected countries. Over the coming weeks healthcare workers including urologists will be facing increasingly difficult challenges and consequently they should adopt sufficient protection strategies to guard against infection when dealing with COVID-19 patients.
