    abstract = {Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has been detected in dogs suffering from respiratory disease and is thought to be involved in canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex. Canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV) is a widespread pathogen of dogs, responsible for mild to severe diarrhea in pups. The purpose of this study was to establish the seroprevalence of CRCoV in Italy and its relationship to CECoV type II seroprevalence. The age and year of sample collection from seropositive dogs was also assessed. Of adult domestic dogs, 23.3% had antibodies to CRCoV, compared with 86.1% with antibodies to CECoV. Amongst a population of kenneled pups, 4.0% had antibodies to CRCoV, and 97.0% had antibodies to CECoV. Â© 2007 American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians.},
