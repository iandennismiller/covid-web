    abstract = {Avian coronavirus (commonly known as Infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) is of major economic importance to commercial chicken producers worldwide. Due to the existence of multiple serotypes and variants of the virus that do not cross-protect, it is important to diagnose circulating serotypes and choose the right vaccine type for successful protection. In an effort to improve conventional diagnostic tests, a microsphere-based assay was developed and evaluated for simultaneous detection of the most common IBV vaccine serotypes in the United States: Arkansas (Ark), Connecticut (Conn), Massachusetts (Mass), Delaware (DE072), and Georgia 98 (GA98). The analytical specificity and sensitivity, and diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, were evaluated. The microsphere-based assay was highly specific to designated serotypes and generated reproducible data. Comparing the microsphere-based assay to nucleotide sequencing, the 2 methods agreed more than 93% (kappa value > .77). In addition, the microsphere-based assay could detect coinfections in clinical samples. The results demonstrate the utility of the microsphere-based assay as a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool with the potential for high throughput diagnosis. },
