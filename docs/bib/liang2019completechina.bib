    abstract = {Copyright Â© 2019 Liang et al. In 2016 and 2018, two porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains, CH-01 and HNZK-02, were identified from fecal samples of piglets with diarrhea in Henan Province, China. The full-length genomic sequence analysis indicated that these two strains had high nucleotide identities with the other Chinese PDCoV epidemic strains.},
