    abstract = {The multiplication of murine coronavirus strains A59 or JHM in Sac(-) cells was unaffected by the presence of Î±-amanitin at concentrations which inhibited the host cell DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. In cells infected with the A59 virus strain, actinomycin D-resistant RNA synthesis could readily be detected by pulse-labelling with [3H]uridine; this virus-specific RNA synthesis was not induced in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. A new RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was detected in the large particle fraction of A59 virus-infected cells. Optimal conditions for enzyme activity in vitro were established. Maximum activity occurred 5 h after infection, coincident with the peak of virus-specific RNA synthesis detected by pulse-labelling in vivo.},
