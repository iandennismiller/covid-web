    abstract = {The seroprevalence of feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies was studied in cats in southern Italy. One hundred twenty sera collected from cats belonging to catteries or community shelters and to households were tested for FCoV type I and II antibodies. The virus neutralization (VN) was performed and compared with indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ninety-six sera tested positive for FCoV antibodies by VN and ELISA. Interestingly, ELISA revealed 2 more positive sera than did the VN test and 3 more positive sera than did the IFAT. All results were confirmed by Western blotting. ELISA proved to be more sensitive and detected a seroprevalence of about 82%. Considering the cross-reactivity of FCoV type I and type II, ELISA was able to detect antibodies against both serotypes, allowing the use of the assay as a reference test for sera screening. The high prevalence of antibodies observed indicates that FCo. Vs are common in southern Italian cat populations.},
