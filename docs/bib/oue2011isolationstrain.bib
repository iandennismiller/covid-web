    abstract = {A new equine coronavirus was isolated from the feces of adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease. The disease outbreak was mainly observed among 2- to 4-year-old horses living in stables of a draft-horse racetrack in Japan. On comparing the isolated virus (isolate Tokachi09) with the equine coronavirus NC99 strain, no significant differences were observed in several biological properties such as hemagglutinating activity, antigenicity (in indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization tests), and one-step growth (in cell culture). The sequences of the nucleocapsid and spike genes of isolate Tokachi09 showed identical size (1341 and 4092 nucleotides, 446 and 1363 amino acids, respectively) and high similarity (98.0% and 99.0% at the nucleotides, 97.3% and 99.0% at the amino acids, respectively) to those of strain NC99. However, the isolate had a 185-nucleotide deletion from four bases after the 3'-terminal end of the spike gene, resulting in the absence of the open reading frame predicted to encode a 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein in strain NC99. These results suggest that the 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein is not essential for viral replication, at least in cell culture, and that the Japanese strain probably originated from a different lineage to the North American strain. This is the first equine coronavirus to be isolated from adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease. },
