    abstract = {The 2019 coronavirus pandemic, which started in Wuhan, China, spread around the globe with dramatic and lethal effects. From the initial Chinese epicenter, the European diaspora taxed the resources of several countries and especially those of Italy, which was forced into a complete social and economic shutdown. Infection by droplets contaminating hands and surfaces represents the main vehicle of diffusion of the virus. The common and strong efforts to contain the pandemic have relevant effects on the management of samples from histopathology laboratories. The current commentary reports and focuses on the protocols and guidelines in use at a large tertiary Italian hospital that accordingly are proposed for adoption in Italian laboratories as a potential model for national guidelines for the coronavirus emergency.},
