    abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7a is an accessory protein with no known homologues. In this study, we report the interaction of a SARS-CoV 7a and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein (SGT). SARS-CoV 7a and human SGT interaction was identified using a two-hybrid system screen and confirmed with interaction screens in cell culture and cellular co-localization studies. The SGT domain of interaction was mapped by deletion mutant analysis and results indicated that tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (aa 125-158) was essential for interaction. We also showed that 7a interacted with SARS-CoV structural proteins M (membrane) and E (envelope), which have been shown to be essential for virus-like particle formation. Taken together, our results coupled with data from studies of the interaction between SGT and HIV-1 vpu indicated that SGT could be involved in the life-cycle, possibly assembly of SARS-CoV.
