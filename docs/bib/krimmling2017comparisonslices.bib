    abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. Coronaviruses as well as influenza A viruses are widely spread in pig fattening and can cause high economical loss. Here we infected porcine precision-cut lung slices with porcine respiratory coronavirus and two Influenza A viruses to analyze if co-infection with these viruses may enhance disease outcome in swine. Ciliary activity of the epithelial cells in the bronchus of precision-cut lung slices was measured. Co-infection of PCLS reduced virulence of both virus species compared to mono-infection. Similar results were obtained by mono- and co-infection experiments on a porcine respiratory cell line. Again lower titers in co-infection groups indicated an interference of the two RNA viruses. This is in accordance with in vivo experiments, revealing cell innate immune answers to both PRCoV and SIV that are able to restrict the virulence and pathogenicity of the viruses.},
