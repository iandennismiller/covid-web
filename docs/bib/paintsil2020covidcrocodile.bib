    abstract = {The threat of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to health systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) can be compared metaphorically to a lake in Africa infested with a bask of crocodiles and the saying: "the eye of the crocodile." In the lake, only the eyes of the crocodile appear on the surface while the rest of the body is submerged in water.
