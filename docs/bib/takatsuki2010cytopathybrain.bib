    abstract = {Viral spread during the early stages after infection was compared between a highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), JHMV cl-2 strain (cl-2), and its low-virulent mutant, soluble-receptor-resistant (srr)7. The infection of cells with srr7 (soluble-receptor-resistant mutant 7) is dependent on a known MHV receptor (MHVR), carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1a, whereas cl-2 shows MHVR-independent infection. Initial viral antigens were detected between 12 and 24 h post-inoculation (p.i) in the infiltrating cells that appeared in the subarachnoidal space of mouse brains infected with viruses. There were no significant differences in the intensity or spread of viral antigens in the inflammatory cells between the two viruses. However, 48 h after infection with cl-2, viral antigen-positive cells in the grey matter with the shape of neurons, which do not express MHVR, were detected, while srr7 infection was observed primarily in the white matter. Some of the viral antigen-positive inflammatory cells found in the subarachnoidal space during the early phase of infection reacted with anti-F4/80 or anti-CD11b monoclonal antibodies. Syncytial giant cells (SGCs) expressing viral and CD11b antigens were also detected among these inflammatory cells. These antigen-positive cells appeared in the subarachnoidal space prior to viral antigen spread into the brain parenchyma, indicating that viral encephalitis starts with the infection of infiltrating monocytes which express MHVR. Furthermore, the observation indicates that viral infection has cytopathic effects on the monocyte lineage, which plays a critical role in innate immunity, leading to the rapid spread of viruses during the early stage of infection.
