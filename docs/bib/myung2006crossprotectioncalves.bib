    abstract = {A group 2 human coronavirus designated HECV-4408 was isolated from a child with acute diarrhea and is antigenically and genetically more closely related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) than to human coronavirus OC43 (X. M. Zhang, W. Herbst, K. G. Kousoulas, and J. Storz, J. Med. Virol. 44:152-161, 1994). To determine whether HECV-4408 infects gnotobiotic calves and induces cross-protective immunity against the virulent enteric BCoV DB2 strain, gnotobiotic calves (n = 4) were orally inoculated with HECV-4408 and then challenged with BCoV DB2 at postinoculation day (PID) 21. All calves inoculated with HECV-4408 developed diarrhea at PID 3 to 4 lasting 5 to 9 days. Fecal and nasal virus shedding were first detected by reverse transcription-PCR at PID 3 to 4 and at PID 2 to 4, respectively. After challenge with bovine coronavirus, no diarrhea or virus shedding was detected in calves inoculated with HECV-4408, but a mock-inoculated calf developed diarrhea and fecal and nasal shedding. Fecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG antibodies were first detected at PID 7 and PID 14, respectively. At postchallenge day 7, serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody titers remained the same or increased only twofold compared to prechallenge titers. An additional two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with HECV-4408 and euthanized at PID 5. Moderate villous atrophy was observed in the small intestines, and viral antigen was detected in villous enterocytes of the small and large intestines by immunohistochemistry. These results support and extend the previous report that HECV-4408 is likely a variant of bovine coronavirus. They confirm its infectivity for calves and complete cross-protection against a bovine coronavirus (DB2 strain) showing 98.2% amino acid identity to HECV-4408 in the S protein.
