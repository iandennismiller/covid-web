    abstract = {A novel coronavirus (SCoV) is the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Site-specific proteolysis plays a critical role in regulating a number of cellular and viral processes. Since the main protease of SCoV, also termed 3C-like protease, is an attractive target for drug therapy, we have developed a safe, simple, and rapid genetic screen assay to monitor the activity of the SCoV 3C-like protease. This genetic system is based on the bacteriophage lambda regulatory circuit, in which the viral repressor cI is specifically cleaved to initiate the lysogenic-to-lytic switch. A specific target for the SCoV 3C-like protease, P1/P2 (SAVLQ/SG FRK), was inserted into the lambda phage cI repressor. The target specificity of the SCoV P1/P2 repressor was evaluated by coexpression of this repressor with a chemically synthesized SCoV 3C-like protease gene construct. Upon infection of Escherichia coli cells containing the two plasmids encoding the cI. SCoV P1/P2-cro and the Î²-galactosidase-SCoV 3C-like protease constructs, lambda phage replicated up to 2,000-fold more efficiently than in cells that did not express the SCoV 3C-like protease. This simple and highly specific assay can be used to monitor the activity of the SCoV 3C-like protease, and it has the potential to be used for screening specific inhibitors.},
