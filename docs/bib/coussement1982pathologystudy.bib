    abstract = {Sixteen cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets were infected oronasally with CV777 coronavirus on the second or third day of life. Two uninfected piglets were controls. They were killed at 96 and 120 hours after birth. After an incubation period of 22 to 36 hours, all principals showed severe diarrhea. The principals were killed between 12 and 120 hours after infection. Exfoliation of enterocytes was seen first in the piglet killed 24 hours after infection (two hours after the diarrhea began). From that time on, shortening and fusion of villi was present in all small intestinal parts. Affected cells showed vacuolation. The histochemical study showed that infected piglets had decreased activity of all four enzymes studied. The light microscope showed no lesions in the absorptive colonic epithelium. The significance of the lesions in relation to intestinal dysfunction is discussed, and lesions are compared to those of transmissible gastroenteritis and porcine rotavirus infection.
