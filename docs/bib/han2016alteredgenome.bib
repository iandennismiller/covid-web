    abstract = {An infectious bronchitis coronavirus, designated as ck/CH/LGX/130530, was isolated from an IBV strain H120-vaccinated chicken in this study. Analysis of the S1 gene showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 was a tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus, with a nucleotide sequence similarity of 99%. However, a complete genomic sequence analysis showed that ck/CH/LGX/130530 was more closely related to a Massachusetts type strain (95% similarity to strain H120) than to the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (86%), suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. A Sim. Plot analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, and it showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 emerged from a recombination event between parental IBV H120 strain and pathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus. The results obtained from the pairwise comparison and nucleotide similarity showed that the recombination breakpoint was located in the nsp14 gene at nucleotides 17055-17083. In line with the high S1 gene sequence similarity, the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate was serotypically close to that of the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (73% antigenic relatedness). Furthermore, vaccination with the LDT3-A vaccine, which was derived from the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain by serial passaging in chicken eggs, provided good protection against challenge with the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, in contrast to the poor protection offered with the H120 vaccine. Interestingly, isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 exhibited low pathogenicity toward specific-pathogen-free chickens compared with the nephropathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, which was likely due to natural recombination in the 5' 17-kb region of the genome. Our results also indicate that the replicase gene of IBV isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 is associated with viral pathogenicity.},
