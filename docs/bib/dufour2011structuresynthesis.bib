    abstract = {Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genomic RNA transcription generates 5'- and 3'-cotermi-nal subgenomic mRNAs. This process involves a discontinuous step during the synthesis of minus-sense RNA that is modulated by transcription-regulating sequences located at the 3' end of the leader (TRS-L) and also preceding each viral gene (TRS-Bs). TRSs include a highly conserved core sequence (CS) (5'-CUAAAC-3') and variable flanking sequences. It has been previously proposed that TRS-Bs act as attenuation or stop signals during the synthesis of minus-sense RNAs. The nascent minus-stranded RNA would then be transferred by a template switch process to the TRS-L, which acts as the acceptor RNA. To study whether the TRS-L is structured and to determine whether this structure has a functional impact on genomic and subgenomic viral RNA synthesis, we have used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and UV thermal denaturation approaches together with site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo transcriptional analyses. The results indicated that a 36-nucleotide oligomer encompassing the wild-type TRS-L forms a structured hairpin closed by an apical AACUAAA heptaloop. This loop contains most of the CS and is isolated from a nearby internal loop by a short Watson-Crick base-paired stem. TRS-L mutations altering the structure and the stability of the TRS-L hairpin affected replication and transcription, indicating the requirement of a functional RNA hairpin structure in these processes. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},
