    abstract = {The nucleotide sequences of the nucleoprotein genes of three enterotropic strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-Y, MHV-RI and DVIM) were determined and compared with previously reported sequences of three polytropic (respiratory) strains (MHV-A59, MHV-JHM and MHV-S). Greater than 92% homology was found among the six strains by pair-wise comparison at the nucleotide level. The genes encoded proteins of 451 to 455 residues and the deduced amino acid sequences were more than 91% homologous. A unique deletion of twelve nucleotides was found at the carboxy terminus of MHV-Y and a three nucleotide deletion was found in MHV-RI, which corresponded to the one previously reported in MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Two internal open reading frames were found within the coding region of the nucleoprotein, the smaller one was specific for the enterotropic strains. It could potentially encode a truncated version of the hypothetical protein described for MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Sequence relationship of the N gene showed no correlation with tissue tropism and no sequence or even single amino acid change unique to either tropism group was found. This indicates that the nucleoprotein of MHV probably has no part in the determination of the primary tissue tropism of an MHV strain. The role of the potential internal protein warrants further investigation. },
