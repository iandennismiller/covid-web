    abstract = {The 3'proximal one-third of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome encodes the structural proteins and eight accessory proteins, including 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b, varying in length from 39 to 274. aa which do not share significant homology with viral proteins of known coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV protein 6 is 63 amino acids in length and has been previously involved in virus pathogenicity and replication. To further analyze this functions, the interaction of SARS-CoV protein 6 with other viral and/or cellular factors has been analyzed during SARS-CoV infective cycle. Protein 6 immunoprecipitation from extracts of SARS-CoV infected cells and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an interaction of viral proteins 6 and 9b in biologically relevant conditions. This interaction has been reinforced by co-localization of both proteins in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV infected cells. },
