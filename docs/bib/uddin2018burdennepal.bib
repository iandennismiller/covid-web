Background Knowledge of risk factors for symptomatic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections in children in community settings is limited. We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. Methods Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. Results Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3-286.5) per 1000 person-years, and was more than twice as high among nonneonates than among neonates (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52-4.21). HCoV ARI incidence was also positively associated with the number of children <5 years of age per room in a household (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28). Of the 296 HCoV infections detected, 46% were coinfections with other respiratory viruses. While HCo. Vs were detected throughout the study period, seasonal variation was also observed, with incidence peaking in 2 winters (December-February) and 1 autumn (September-November). Conclusions HCoV is associated with a substantial proportion of illnesses among young infants in rural Nepal. There is an increased risk of HCoV infection beyond the first month of life.},
