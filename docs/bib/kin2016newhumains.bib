    abstract = {© 2016 Elsevier Masson SASHuman coronaviruses (HCoV) are single strand RNA viruses. To date, there are four so-called « classical » or « novel » HCo. Vs, characterized by a winter circulation. These coronaviruses are responsible for mild respiratory infection in general population. However, HCo. Vs are associated to more severe respiratory tract infection among susceptible population. Indeed, HCo. Vs account for 2 to 7% of hospitalizations due to a respiratory infection, particularly among children, immunocompromised or elderly people. Thereby, HCo. Vs are included in the panel of respiratory viruses detected in routine using molecular biology tools. These four circulating HCo. Vs have to be distinguished from the two emerging HCo. Vs: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These later are associated to a more severe respiratory infection and differ from other HCo. Vs by their increased epidemic potential, their more important health impact, and their atypical circulation. Such as paramyxoviruses and Influenza viruses, coronaviruses have to be monitored due to their associated risk of emergence in human population from animal reservoirs.},
