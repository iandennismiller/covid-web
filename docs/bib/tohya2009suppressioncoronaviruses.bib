    abstract = {nsp1 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a group 2b CoV, suppresses host gene expression by promoting host mRNA degradation and translation inhibition. The present study analyzed the activities of nsp1 proteins from the group 2 bat CoV strains Rm1, 133, and HKU9-1, belonging to groups 2b, 2c, and 2d, respectively. The host mRNA degradation and translational suppression activities of nsp1 of SARS-CoV and Rm1 nsp1 were similar and stronger than the activities of the nsp1 proteins of 133 and HKU9-1. Rm1 nsp1 expression in trans strongly inhibited the induction of type I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN-stimulated genes in cells infected with an IFN-inducing SARS-CoV mutant, while 133 and HKU9-1 nsp1 proteins had relatively moderate IFN-inhibitory activities. The results of our studies suggested a conserved function among nsp1 proteins of SARS-CoV and group 2 bat Co. Vs. Copyright Â© 2009, American Society for Microbiology. },
