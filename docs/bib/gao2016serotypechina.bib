    abstract = {Since 2009, strains of the naturally recombinant TW I genotype of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have caused considerable damage to the Chinese poultry industry. To better understand the antigenicity and pathogenesis of this genotype, the characteristics of the ck/CH/LDL/140520 strain were compared to those of four commercial IB vaccine strains that are used commonly in China, as well as four attenuated viruses that represent two types of IBV strains, which are believed to have originated in China and are the predominant IBV types circulating in chicken flocks in China and many other parts of the world. The results showed that all eight strains were genetically and serotypically different from the strain ck/CH/LDL/140520. Furthermore, neither the vaccine strains nor the attenuated viruses could provide complete respiratory protection of chickens against a challenge with the ck/CH/LDL/140520 strain, indicating that it is necessary to develop new live vaccines or to evaluate the use of established vaccines in combination to control naturally recombinant TW I-type IBV strains in the future. Our results showed that strain ck/CH/LDL/140520 is very pathogenic, and that it is able to cause cystic oviducts in a high percentage of birds, as well as mortality due to nephritis and respiratory distress with complete tracheal ciliostasis, especially in chickens infected at 1 day of age.},
