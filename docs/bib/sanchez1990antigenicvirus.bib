    abstract = {The antigenic homology of 26 coronavirus isolates, of which 22 were antigenically related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was determined with 42 monoclonal antibodies. Type, group, and interspecies specific epitopes were defined. Two group specific MAbs distinguished the enteric TGEV isolates from the respiratory variants. An antigenic subsite involved in neutralization was conserved in porcine, feline, and canine coronavirus. The classification of the human coronavirus 229E in a taxonomic cluster distinct from TGEV group is suggested. © 1990.},
