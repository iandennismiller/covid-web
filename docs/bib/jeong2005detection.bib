    abstract = {Although winter dysentery (WD) has been suspected to occur frequently in Korea, to date the exact epidemiology of WD has remained unknown. Therefore, we investigated the causative agents of WD by using electron microscopy, ELISA, RT-PCR, and nested PCR from 97 fecal samples of 32 WD-affected herds collected from 8 provinces during 2002-2004. The bovine coronavirus (BoCV) was consistently detected in all herds with WD. Of other pathogens, only coccidian oocyts were inconsistently but concurrently detected with BoCV. Ten isolates were identified as BoCV by immune electron microscope, immunofluorescent test and ELISA with antiserum to BoCV, and RT-PCR. From these results, it is concluded that WD caused by BoCV occurred in relatively high frequency and was widespread in Korea. The results provide important epidemiological data for the control and establishment of a surveillance system for WD in Korea.},
