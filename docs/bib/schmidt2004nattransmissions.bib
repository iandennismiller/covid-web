    abstract = {BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first described in February 2003. Close contact with symptomatic patients appears to be the main route of transmission, whereas blood transfusion transmission could not be ruled out. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) detection kit developed by C. Drosten (Bernhard Nocht Institute, BNI) was used to amplify SARS-CoV sequences from blood donor samples. We tested 31,151 blood donor samples in minipools of up to 96 samples. To validate the sensitivity of the assay, routine donor minipools (88 ± 8 samples per pool) were spiked with plasma of an imported case of SARS or of a subsequently infected contact person, respectively. Gamma-irradiated cell culture supernatants of Vero E6 cells, infected with SARS-CoV, were used as positive controls. RESULTS: None of 31,151 blood donors were positive for the presence of SARS. Two 96-member plasma pools that were each spiked with 100 μL of plasma of the German index patient or his wife, respectively, were positive. Overall, 0.85 percent of test results had to be considered invalid owing to negative internal controls. CONCLUSION: A real-time CoV PCR test is able to detect SARS-CoV in viremic blood donor samples even in the beginning of the disease when patients present minor clinical symptoms. Thus the assay could potentially help to prevent transfusion-associated SARS-CoV transmissions.},
