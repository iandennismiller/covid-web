    abstract = {Coronaviruses were observed by electron microscopy in the intestinal contents of turkeys in Quebec flocks where repeated outbreaks of enteritis occurred. Three isolates could be serially propagated in turkey embryos inoculated by the amniotic route with clarified intestinal contents. Purification and concentration of viral particles contained in intestinal contents of infected embryos were achieved by precipitation with polyethylene glycol and ultracentrifugation on sucrose density gradients. Three particle types were demonstrated: intact virions with a density of 1.18 to 1.20 g/ml and incomplete particles with densities of 1.14 and 1.24 g/ml. Hemagglutination of rabbit and guinea pig erythrocytes was demonstrated with the intact viral particles; the hemagglutinin was not dependent on incubation temperature. All the isolates were antigenically related, as shown by hemagglutination-inhibition. The turkey coronaviruses did not cross-react with antisera against coronaviruses of avian infectious bronchitis, porcine transmissible enteritis, bovine neonatal calf diarrhea, or mouse hepatitis. One of the Quebec isolates was shown to induce syncytia formation on its third passage in primary chicken-embryo kidney cell cultures. Electron-microscopic examination of infected cell-culture fluids revealed characteristics coronavirus particles identical to those found in intestinal contents of infected turkeys.},
