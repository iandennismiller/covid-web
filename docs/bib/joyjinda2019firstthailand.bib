    abstract = {Â© 2019 Joyjinda et al. Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was first detected in a patient with viral pneumonia from Hong Kong in 2004. Here, we report the first complete genome sequence of HCoV-HKU1 from Thailand, obtained from a nonill person who worked in a bat cave. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed it as a group B HCoV-HKU1.},
