    abstract = {The diversity in selected regions of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) genomes was analyzed among known TGEV and PRCV strains and field isolates. The N-terminal half of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene and open reading frames (ORF) 3, 3-1 and 4 were amplified by reverse transcriptase reaction and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR), and analyzed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of the amplified DNA. Reference TGEV strains (Miller and Purdue) and a PRCV strain (ISU-I), and TGEV and PRCV field isolates were analyzed. Based on the size of the ORF 3, 3-1 and 4 RT/PCR products. TGEV and PRCV strains could be quickly and easily differentiated into three groups designated TGEV Miller, Purdue types and PRCV. By RFLP analysis of the N-terminal region of the S glycoprotein gene and ORFs 3, 3-1 and 4, TGEV and PRCV strains were differentiated into five groups using the restriction enzyme SauI. Sequence analysis of a PCR product in the ORFs 3, 3-1 and 4 from virulent and attenuated Miller strains demonstrated additional differences in that region which have been correlated with a change in virulence of TGEV isolates.},
