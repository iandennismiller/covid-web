    abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) structural proteins (S, E, M, and NC) localize in different subcellular positions when expressed individually. However, SARS-CoV M protein is co-localized almost entirely with S, E, or NC protein when co-expressed in the cells. On the other hand, only partial co-localization was observed when S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were co-expressed in the cells. Interactions between SARS-CoV M and other structural proteins but not interactions between S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assay. These results indicate that SARS-CoV M protein, similar to the M proteins of other coronaviruses, plays a pivotal role in virus assembly. The cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of SARS-CoV M protein was responsible for binding to NC protein. Multiple regions of M protein interacted with E and S proteins. A model for the interactions between SARS-CoV M protein and other structural proteins is proposed. This study helps us better understand protein-protein interactions during viral assembly of SARS-CoV. Â© 2008 National Science Council Taipei.},
