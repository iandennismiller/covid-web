Given publication lags, academic periodicals like Medical Education are a terrible place for "news" at the best of times. Our recently started release of "Accepted Articles" ensures this editorial will be made public in days rather than months, but the current situation is changing for many of us by the hour. With no capacity to know the future, the only claim I can make with confidence is that things are different now, when you're reading this text, relative to when it was written.},
