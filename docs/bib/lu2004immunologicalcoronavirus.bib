    abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). There are four major structural proteins in the SARS-CoV, including the nucleocapsid, spike, membrane, and small envelope proteins. In this study, two sets of truncated fragments of spike protein were generated, the first were approximately 210-bp nonoverlapping fragments and the second were overlapping segments of 750 to 900 bp. From these 23 fragments, we identified a fragment of 259 amino acids (amino acids 441 to 700) that is a major immunodominant epitope. This fragment was highly expressed, and the purified fragment C could detect all 33 SARS patient serum samples tested, collected from 7 to 60 days after the onset of fever, but had no reactivity with all 66 healthy human serum samples tested. Thus, fragment C of spike protein was identified as an immunodominant antigen and could be used for serological detection of SARS-CoV infection.},
