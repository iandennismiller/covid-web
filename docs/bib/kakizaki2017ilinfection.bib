    abstract = {© 2017 Japanese Society of Neuropathology. The apoptosis of pyramidal neurons in CA2 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus is induced after infection with Mu-3 virus (Mu-3), a neuropathogenic strain of the JHM virus (JHMV), at 4–5 days post-inoculation (dpi). The viral antigens in the hippocampus are mainly found in the CD11b-positive cells distributed in the stratum oriens located outside the pyramidal layer, and only a few pyramidal neurons are infected. Furthermore, the apoptotic cells, indicated as showing caspase 3 (Cas3) activation, consist of a high number of uninfected cells. Therefore, it is considered that the apoptotic lesions occur through the indirect effects of infection, and not as a result of direct infection with Mu-3, similar to the reported neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus after other types of infection. The apoptosis in the pyramidal neurons is accompanied by various types of proinflammatory cytokines depending on the causative agents. Thus, the local expression of proinflammatory cytokines was studied, revealing no correlation in the distribution of cytokine expression with the subregions showing apoptosis. However, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was produced by pyramidal neurons of CA2 and CA3 at 3 dpi when there is no destructive change or viral invasion in the hippocampus.},
