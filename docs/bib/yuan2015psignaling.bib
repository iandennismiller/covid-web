    abstract = {© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Infection by human coronaviruses is usually characterized by rampant viral replication and severe immunopathology in host cells. Recently, the coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLPs) have been identified as suppressors of the innate immune response. However, the molecular mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that PLP2, a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), deubiquitinates and stabilizes the cellular oncoprotein MDM2 and induces the proteasomal degradation of p53. Meanwhile, we identify IRF7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) as a bona fide target gene of p53 to mediate the p53-directed production of type I interferon and the innate immune response. By promoting p53 degradation, PLP2 inhibits the p53-mediated antiviral response and apoptosis to ensure viral growth in infected cells. Thus, our study reveals that coronavirus engages PLPs to escape from the innate antiviral response of the host by inhibiting p53-IRF7-IFNβ signaling.},
