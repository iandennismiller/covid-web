    abstract = {Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has been declared a worldwide pandemic in March 11, 2020, is a novel infectious disease that causes respiratory illness and death. Pediatric COVID-19 accounts for a small percentage of patients with outbreaks and is often milder than adults, but can progress to severe disease in some cases. Even neonates can suffer from COVID-19, and children may play a role as a spreader in the community. In this review, we summarize what is known about COVID-19 in children and adolescents until now.},
