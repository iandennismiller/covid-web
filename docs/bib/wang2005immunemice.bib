    abstract = {To analyze the immune responses of DNA vaccine encoded different gene fragments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov), SARS-Cov gene fragments of membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), spike a (Sa), and spike b (Sb) proteins were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vector to form plasmids pcDNAM, pcDNAN, pcDNASa, and pcDNASb, respectively. After mice were immunized intramuscularly with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa-pcDNASb plasmid, blood was collected and serum was separated. Humoral immune response was detected with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cellular immune response of SARS-Cov DNA vaccines was detected with lymphoproliferation assay and cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay. Results show that cellular and humoral immune responses can be detected after immunization with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa-pcDNASb plasmids in BALB/c mice. However, pcDNAM stimulated the highest cellular immune response than other plasmids, and pcDNASa-pcDNASb stimulated the highest humoral immune response in week 12. The present results not only suggest that DNA immunization with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa-pcDNASb could be used as potential DNA vaccination approaches to induce antibody in BALB/c mice, but also to illustrate that gene immunization with these SARS DNA vaccines different immune response characters.
