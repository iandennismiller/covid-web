    abstract = {SARS coronavirus, SCV, has been recently responsible of a sudden and widespread infection which caused almost 800 victims. The limited amount of SCV protein structural information is partially responsible of the lack of specific drugs against the virus. Coronavirus helicases are very conserved and peculiar proteins which have been proposed as suitable targets for antiviral drugs, such as bananins, which have been recently shown to inhibit the SCV helicase in vitro. Here, the quaternary structure of SCV helicase has been predicted, which will provide a solid foundation for the rational design of other antiviral helicase inhibitors. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc. },
