Who could have predicted that this is the year in which we are called to prevent illness, promote health, care for the sick, and bring comfort to the dying, in ways that haven't been seen since other pandemics (e.g., the flu pandemic of 1918 or the yellow fever epidemics that were experienced in the United States in 1793 and then in recurring waves).},
