    abstract = {An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of the coronavirus-like agent in feces of pigs naturally affected with porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) or experimentally infected with the CV777 isolate. The assay was specific and more sensitive than electron microscopy. An ELISA blocking assay is described for the detection and titration of antibodies. Specific antibody formation was demonstrated in pigs experimentally infected with CV777 and in swine naturally affected with PED. Â© 1982.},
