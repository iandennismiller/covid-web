    abstract = {The coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is an RNA binding protein which is phosphorylated at two conserved clusters. Kinetic analysis of RNA binding indicated that the C-terminal phosphorylation cluster was involved in the recognition of viral RNA from non-viral RNA. The IBV N protein has been found to be essential for the successful recovery of IBV using reverse genetics systems. Rescue experiments indicated that phosphorylated N protein recovered infectious IBV more efficiently when compared to modified N proteins either partially or non-phosphorylated. Our data indicate that the phosphorylated form of the IBV N protein plays a role in virus biology. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc. },
