    abstract = {Background: A detailed laboratory investigation identified bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as the aetiological agent in an outbreak of respiratory disease at a semi-intensive beef cattle feedlot in south-east Australia. The outbreak caused 30% morbidity in the resident population and also affected two cohorts of cattle that were newly introduced to the property. Methods: At slaughter, pulmonary consolidation and inflammatory lesions in the trachea were identified in 15 of 49 animals. Pasteurella multocida or Histophilus somni was cultured from 3 of 7 animals with lesions. Histopathological examination revealed multifocal non-suppurative bronchointerstitial pneumonia with formation of epithelial syncytial cells, sometimes associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia. Results: BCoV was detected in nasal swabs and pulmonary lesions using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay and virus isolation. There was serological evidence of previous exposure to bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, but not to bovine herpesvirus type 1. None of these viral pathogens or Mycoplasma bovis was identified by qRT-PCR. Conclusion: This is believed to be the first report of BCoV in association with bovine respiratory disease complex in Australia.
