    abstract = {Despite years of research, the precise determinants of coronavirus replication and pathogenesis remain unidentified. What is known of the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is limited, but clinical observations suggest that both viral-induced cytotoxicity and host immune-mediated destruction contribute to the severity of disease. This summary discusses recent advances in coronavirus research that will facilitate the identification of crucial molecular targets for the rational design of SARS therapeutics.
