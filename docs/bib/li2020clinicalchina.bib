    abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. METHODS: The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiological assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. RESULTS: The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-dimer, LDH and lactate levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19 we summarized, which would be helpful to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.},
