    abstract = {Complete nucleotide sequences were determined by cDNA cloning of peplomer (S), integral membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) type I strain KU-2, UCD1 and Black, and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) type II strain 79-1683. Only M and N genes were analyzed in strain KU-2 and strain 79-1683, which still had unknown nucleotide sequences. Deduced amino acid sequences of S, M and N proteins were compared in a total of 7 strains of coronaviruses, which included FIPV type II strain 79-1146, canine coronavirus (CCV) strain Insavc-1 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) strain Purdue. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of M and N proteins revealed that both M and N proteins had an identity of at least 90% between FIPV type I and type II. The phylogenetic tree of the M and N protein-deduced amino acid sequences showed that FIPV type I and type II form a group with FECV type II, and that these viruses were evolutionarily distant from CCV and TGEV. On the other hand, when the S protein-deduced amino acid sequences was compared, identity of only about 45% was found between FIPV type I and type II. The phylogenetic tree of the S protein-deduced amino acid sequences indicated that three strains of FIPV type I form a group, and that it is a very long distance from the FIPV type II, FECV type II, CCV and TGEV groups.},
