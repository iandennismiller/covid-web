    abstract = {Passive immunity against enteric viral infections is dependent upon the continual presence in the gut lumen of a protective level of specific antibodies. This article examines methods currently used to enhance the titre and duration of specific antibody in the mammary secretions of cows and pigs with particular reference to rotavirus and coronavirus infections. In addition, some of the potential problems to be found in attempting to produce vaccines against these viral infections are outlined. Â© 1985 Butterworth & Co (Publishers) Ltd.},
