    abstract = {The N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein from human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43 N-NTD) mostly contains positively charged residues and has been identified as being responsible for RNA binding during ribonucleocapsid formation in the coronavirus. In this study, the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (amino acids 58-195) with a molecular weight of 20 kDa are reported. HCoV-OC43 N-NTD was crystallized at 293 K using PEG 1500 as a precipitant and a 99.9% complete native data set was collected to 1.7 Å resolution at 100 K with an overall Rmerge of 5.0%. The crystals belonged to the hexagonal space group P65, with unit-cell parameters a = 81.57, c = 42.87 Å. Solvent-content calculations suggest that there is likely to be one subunit of N-NTD in the asymmetric unit. © 2010 International Union of Crystallography. },
