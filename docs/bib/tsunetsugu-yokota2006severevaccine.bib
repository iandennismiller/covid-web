    abstract = {SARS-CoV is a new type of human coronavirus identified as a causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). On the occasion of the SARS outbreak, various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV have been developed and applied for diagnosis, clinical management and basic research. In this review, we overview the biochemical and functional properties and applications of these SARS-CoV mAbs. We also focus on a variety of vaccines currently under development and discuss the immune response elicited by these vaccines in animal models, hopefully to better understand what we need to do next to fight against newly emerging pathogens in the future.
