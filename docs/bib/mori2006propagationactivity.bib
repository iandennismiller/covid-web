    abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine whether bovine coronavirus (BCV) has the ability to initiate infection in a human colon carcinoma cell line, Caco-2, that has been established to spontaneously differentiate after confluence. When Caco-2 cells were infected with BCV, a titer of 5.5 × 106 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.)/mL was found in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection. Two clones, Caco-2/CA1 and Caco-2/CA2, were then isolated by monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cell proliferation activities. The ALP activity level of CA1 cells was significantly higher than that of CA2 cells, while the level of cell proliferation activity of CA1 was significantly lower than that of CA2. When CA1 and CA2 cells were infected with BCV at confluence, virus hemagglutination (HA) was detected in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection for CA1 cells and at 8 days postinfection for CA2 cells. Thus, BCV propagation was substantially delayed in CA2 cells, suggesting that a cellular factor(s) that appears at the differentiation stage may control BCV propagation. BCV-susceptible CA1 and CA2 cells showing different levels of ALP activity would be useful for further experiments to elucidate the mechanism of BCV propagation. © 2006 Japanese Society of Animal Science.},
