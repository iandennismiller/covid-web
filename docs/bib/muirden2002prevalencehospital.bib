    abstract = {A total of 517 stray cats at an RSPCA veterinary hospital were tested for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). The prevalence of FeLV was 3.5 per cent in all the cats, 1.4 per cent in healthy cats and 6.9 per cent in sick cats. FeLV positivity was associated only with disease of non-traumatic origin. Antibodies to FCoV were present in 22.4 per cent of the cats, and their prevalence was significantly higher in cats over two years old and in feral/semiferal cats. The prevalence of antibodies to FIV was 10.4 per cent in all the cats, 4.9 per cent in healthy cats and 16.7 per cent in sick cats. The prevalence of FIV antibodies was significantly higher in entire males and neutered males than in females, in cats over two years old compared with younger cats, and in cats suffering disease of non-traumatic origin rather than in healthy cats or cats suffering only from trauma. Sex, age and health status were each independently highly associated with FIV antibodies.},
