    abstract = {The parts of the RNA genome of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) required for replication and packaging of the RNA were investigated using deletion mutagenesis of a defective RNA (D-RNA) CD-61 (6.1 kb) containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. A D-RNA with the first 544, but not as few as 338, nucleotides (nt) of the 5' terminus was replicated; the 5' untranslated region (UTR) comprises 528 nt. Region I of the 3' UTR, adjacent to the nucleocapsid protein gene, comprised 212 nt and could be removed without impairment of replication or packaging of D-RNAs. A D-RNA with the final 338 nt, including the 293 nt in the highly conserved region II of the 3' UTR, was replicated. Thus, the 5'-terminal 544 nt and 3'-terminal 338 nt contained the necessary signals for RNA replication. Phylogenetic analysis of 19 strains of IBV and 3 strains of turkey coronavirus predicted a conserved stem-loop structure at the 5' end of region II of the 3' UTR. Removal of the predicted stem-loop structure abolished replication of the D-RNAs. D-RNAs in which replicase gene 1b-derived sequences had been removed or replaced with all the downstream genes were replicated well but were rescued poorly, suggesting inefficient packaging. However, no specific part of the 1b gene was required for efficient packaging.},
