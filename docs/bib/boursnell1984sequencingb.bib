    abstract = {DNA sequencing of genomic cDNA clones of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been carried out. 770 bases have been determined which include genomic sequences spanning the 5' termini of the two smallest mRNAs of the 3'-coterminal "nested" set: mRNA A and mRNA B. This region contains the complete coding sequences for mRNA B which are additional to those present in mRNA A. Two open reading frames are present, predicting proteins of Mrs 7500 and 9500.
