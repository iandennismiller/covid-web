    abstract = {Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), which is more closely related to the bovine coronavirus (BCoV), has recently been detected in dogs. In this study, we examined whether BCoV was capable of infecting and exhibiting pathogenicity in dogs. Three 1-month-old pups were oronasally given field isolates of BCoV, and were kept together with 2 control animals. As a result, increases in BCoV-neutralizing antibody titers were confirmed in all pups in the challenged and control groups. Moreover, the virus gene was also detected in oral and rectal swabs by RT-PCR. These results indicate that BCoV infects dogs, and easily infects other dogs that are kept together. However, no clinical symptoms such as respiratory symptoms and diarrhea were observed.},
