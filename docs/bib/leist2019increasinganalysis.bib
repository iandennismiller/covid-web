Newly emerging viral pathogens pose a constant and unpredictable threat to human and animal health. Coronaviruses (Co. Vs) have a penchant for sudden emergence, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and most recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression. However, rodent models are often criticized for their limited translatability to humans. The complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the United States serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis. We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (Vet. Scan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood. MERS-CoV lung titer peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with lymphopenia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, two phenomena also observed in MERS-CoV infection of humans. The fluctuations in leukocyte populations measured by Vetscan HM5 were corroborated by standard flow cytometry, thus confirming the utility of this approach. Comparing a sublethal and lethal dose of MERS-CoV in mice, analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of leukocytes. Major leukocyte populations were modulated before weight loss was observed. Importantly, neutrophil counts on 1dpi were predictive of disease severity with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV highlighting the predictive value of hematology in this model. Taken together, the inclusion of hematological measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis increases their translatability and should elevate the preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition.},
