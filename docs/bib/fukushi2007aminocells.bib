    abstract = {To clarify the molecular basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) adaptation to different host species, we serially passaged SARS-CoV in rat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells. After 15 passages, the virus (Rat-P15) came to replicate effectively in rat ACE2-expressing cells. Two amino acid substitutions in the S2 region were found on the Rat-P15 S gene. Analyses of the infectivity of the pseudotype-bearing S protein indicated that the two substitutions in the S2 region, especially the S950F substitution, were responsible for efficient infection. Therefore, virus adaptation to different host species can be induced by amino acid substitutions in the S2 region. Copyright Â© 2007, American Society for Microbiology. },
