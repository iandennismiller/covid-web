    abstract = {bjectives: The identification and analysis of viral etiological agents from suspected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases admitted to Prof. Dr. Sulianti Saroso Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) using molecular assays. Methods: Biological samples were collected from 13 hospitalized patients suspected of MERS-CoV infection in Prof. Dr. Sulianti Saroso IDH from July 2015 to December 2016. The majority of patients presented with pneumonia, with symptoms including fever (≥37.5 °C), labored breathing, and cough, and with a history of travel to the Middle East. Viral RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA, which was used as a template for the detection of 12 viral panels using conventional PCR and sequencing. Results: Viral etiological agents detected in the patients were enterovirus D68, dengue virus type 3, rhinovirus C, human coronavirus 229E, herpes simplex virus type 1, influenza virus H1N1, influenza virus H3N2, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus A60. Conclusions: The sequences of nine viral agents under different taxa were detected in suspected MERS-CoV patients, including influenza virus, paramyxovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, and herpesvirus.},
