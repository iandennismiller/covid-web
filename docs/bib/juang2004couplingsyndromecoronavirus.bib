    abstract = {An early and accurate diagnostic assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is crucial for infection control. However, most of the diagnostic methods available today, such as real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), require a second detection method for confirmation because they detect a single sequence region of the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For sensitive and accurate early diagnosis, we report a novel assay system combining multiplex RT-PCR and a diagnostic gene chip to detect multiple virus-specific genomic sequences of SARS-CoV. With 53 clinical specimens, we successfully demonstrate that this technique offers not only a high-accuracy diagnosis for early SARS infection but also a semiquantitative assay.},
