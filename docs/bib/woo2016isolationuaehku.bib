    abstract = {licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Recently, we reported the discovery of a dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 (Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23) from dromedaries in the Middle East. In this study, Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23 was successfully isolated in two of the 14 dromedary fecal samples using HRT-18G cells, with cytopathic effects observed five days after inoculation. Northern blot analysis revealed at least seven distinct RNA species, corresponding to predicted subgenomic mRNAs and confirming the core sequence of transcription regulatory sequence motifs as 5สน-UCUAAAC-3สน as we predicted previously. Antibodies against Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23 were detected in 58 (98.3%) and 59 (100%) of the 59 dromedary sera by immunofluorescence and neutralization antibody tests, respectively. There was significant correlation between the antibody titers determined by immunofluorescence and neutralization assays (Pearson coefficient = 0.525, p < 0.0001). Immunization of mice using recombinant N proteins of Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively, and heat-inactivated Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23 showed minimal cross-antigenicity between Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV by Western blot and neutralization antibody assays. Codon usage and genetic distance analysis of Rd. Rp, S and N genes showed that the 14 strains of Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23 formed a distinct cluster, separated from those of other closely related members of Betacoronavirus 1, including alpaca CoV, confirming that Dc. CoV UAE-HKU23 is a novel member of Betacoronavirus 1.},
