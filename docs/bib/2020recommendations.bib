    abstract = {Infection with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and the disease this agent may induce, are a cause of notable concern for the general population and, of course, among our professionals and patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a high-risk diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the case of upper GI examinations, and a moderate to low-risk intervention when involving lower GI explorations. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of patients infected with the virus, and occasionally in colonic biopsy samples, has been consistently documented. In fact, viral elimination in the feces may be more prolonged than viral identification in respiratory tract secretions. Furthermore, viral transmission may occur in asymptomatic individuals. However, as of this moment no information has been reported on the possibility of viral transmission, even to professionals, via this route.},
