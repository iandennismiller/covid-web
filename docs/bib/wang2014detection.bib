    abstract = {In Ohio, United States, in early 2014, a deltacoronavirus was detected in feces and intestine samples from pigs with diarrheal disease. The complete genome sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the virus confirmed that the virus is closely related to a porcine deltacoronavirus (porcine coronavirus HKU15) reported in Hong Kong in 2012.},
