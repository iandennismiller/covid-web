    abstract = {The occurrence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies to human coronavirus OC43 was investigated in a material of random sera in Finland from 283 subjects including children and adults. Antibodies were found in 172 (60.8%). The highest incidence of positive sera was obtained from the age groups between 21 and 50 years-about 85% of the investigated sera were positive in these age groups. It can be concluded that infections with OC43 or related coronaviruses are rather common in Finland. Â© 1974, Informa UK Ltd. },
