    abstract = {The distribution of human coronavirus strain 229E (HCV 229E) particles on the surface of human diploid (MRCc) cells was examined. Virus particles showed a totally random distribution on fixed cells and on cells to which virus had been adsorbed in the cold. A marked redistribution of virus particles was observed on warming virus-cell preparations to 33 Â°C for 20 min, the peripheral areas of the cell becoming relatively devoid of virus particles while the majority of particles were now located some distance from the edge of the cell. Redistribution did not occur in the presence of metabolic inhibitors.},
