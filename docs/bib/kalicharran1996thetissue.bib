    abstract = {The replication of JHM, a murine coronavirus, provides a useful model of the assembly and dissemination of viral components in neuronal cells. Involvement of microtubules in virus trafficking is an important feature which may explain dissemination of the infection from primary cell targets at olfactory, hippocampal and cerebellar sites within the central nervous system, resulting in severe neuropathies.},
