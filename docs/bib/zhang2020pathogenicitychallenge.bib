    abstract = {Â© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbHIn this study, the pathogenicity of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain NH (passage 10, P10) was evaluated. We found that PDCoV strain NH is enteropathogenic in 5-day-old pigs. Pathogenicity experiments provided a challenge model for studying the protection efficiency of passive immunity. In order to investigate the protective efficacy of passive immunity in newborn piglets, pregnant sows were vaccinated with either a PDCoV-inactivated vaccine at the Houhai acupoint (n = 5) or DMEM as a negative control (n = 2) using a prime/boost strategy 20 and 40 days before delivery. PDCoV spike (S)-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (NA) responses were detected in immunized sows and piglets born to immunized sows. PDCoV spike (S)-specific sIgA was also detected in the colostrum and milk of immunized sows. Five days post-farrowing, piglets were orally challenged with PDCoV strain NH (105 TCID50/piglet). Severe diarrhoea, high levels of viral RNA copies and substantial intestinal villus atrophy were detected in piglets born to unimmunized sows. Only 4 of 31 piglets (12.9%) born to immunized sows in the challenge group displayed mild to moderate diarrhoea, lower viral RNA copies and minor intestinal villi damage compared to piglets born to unimmunized sows post-challenge. Mock piglets exhibited no typical clinical symptoms. The challenge experiment results indicated that the inactivated PDCoV vaccine exhibited 87.1% protective efficacy in the piglets. These findings suggest that the inactivated PDCoV vaccine has the potential to be an effective vaccine, providing protection against virulent PDCoV.},
