    abstract = {Infection of the type II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79-1146 to primary feline alveolar macrophages and human monocyte cell line U937 was enhanced by the sera of cats experimentally infected with the 79-1146 strain, but not those of cats infected with KU-2 or UCD-1 strain of type I FIPV. The experiments using sera of cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and of cats naturally infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV) revealed that infection of the FIPV 79-1146 strain to the U937 cells was enhanced only by the sera of cats infected with type II FIPV or feline enteric coronavirus. The samples positive for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity had high neutralizing antibody titers against the FIPV 79-1146 strain and the samples negative for ADE activity had low neutralizing antibody titers. These findings support the previous results where a monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity had high ADE activity, suggesting that there was a close relationship between the neutralization and enhancement sites. And then it is also suggested that ADE of infection is likely to be induced by re-infection with the same serotype of virus in type II FIPV infection. Furthermore, U937 cells are considered useful and can be substituted for the feline macrophages for determining ADE of FIPV-infection.},
