    abstract = {During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, approximately 10% of SARS patients developed progressive respiratory failure and died. Since then, several animal models have been established to study SARS coronavirus, with the aim of developing new antiviral agents and vaccines. This short review describes the pathologic features of SARS in relation to their clinical presentation in human cases. It also looks at animal susceptibility after experimental infection, animal models of SARS, and the pathogenesis of this disease. It seems that adaptation of the virus within the host animal and the subsequent abnormal immune responses may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new and fatal respiratory disease. The proteases produced in the lung during inflammation could also play an important role for exacerbation of SARS in animals. Â© The American College of Veterinary Pathologists 2010.},
