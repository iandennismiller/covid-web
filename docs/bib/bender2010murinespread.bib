    abstract = {Coronavirus infection of the murine central nervous system (CNS) provides a model for studies of viral encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) neurotropism varies by strain: MHV-A59 causes mild encephalomyelitis and demyelination, while the highly neurovirulent strain JHM. SD (MHV-4) causes fatal encephalitis with extensive neuronal spread of virus. In addition, while neurons are the predominant CNS cell type infected in vivo, the canonical receptor for MHV, the carcinoembryonic antigen family member CEACAM1a, has been demonstrated only on endothelial cells and microglia. In order to investigate whether CEACAM1a is also expressed in other cell types, ceacam1a mRNA expression was quantified in murine tissues and primary cells. As expected, among CNS cell types, microglia expressed the highest levels of ceacam1a, but lower levels were also detected in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Given the low levels of neuronal expression of ceacam1a, primary neurons from wild-type and ceacam1a knockout mice were inoculated with MHV to determine the extent to which CEACAM1a-independent infection might contribute to CNS infection. While both A59 and JHM. SD infected small numbers of ceacam1a knockout neurons, only JHM. SD spread efficiently to adjacent cells in the absence of CEACAM1a. Quantification of mRNA for the ceacam1a-related genes ceacam2 and psg16 (bCEA), which encode proposed alternative MHV receptors, revealed low ceacam2 expression in microglia and oligodendrocytes and psg16 expression exclusively in neurons; however, only CEACAM2 mediated infection in human 293T cells. Therefore, neither CEACAM2 nor PSG16 is likely to be an MHV receptor on neurons, and the mechanism for CEACAM1a-independent neuronal spread of JHM. SD remains unknown.
