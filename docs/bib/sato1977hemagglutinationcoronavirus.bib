    abstract = {The virus was grown in BEK-1 cells, a stable cell line from bovine embryo kidney, and tested for hemagglutination (HA) with erythrocytes of a variety of species at 4°C, room temperature and 37°C. HA was observed at all temperatures with chicken, mouse, rat, and hamster erythrocytes but not with erthyrocytes of human (O), cattle, horses, sheep, guinea pigs, geese, ducks, pigeons and 1-day-old chicks. Chickens showed an individual variation in agglutinability of their erythrocytes, requiring selection of birds to obtain erythrocytes for HA. HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in HA and HA inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were worked out. © 1977.},
