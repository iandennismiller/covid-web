    abstract = {Background: Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a novel respiratory virus which is associated with respiratory tract infections in children. Objective: To determine the role of HCoV-NL63 in infants and young children hospitalised with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: Respiratory specimens were collected from 1055 infants and young children hospitalised with ARI in 2003-2004. Samples were screened by RT-PCR to detect HCoV-NL63 and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Standard shell vial culture and immunofluoresence was used to detect the common respiratory viruses including RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, adenovirus and CMV. Results: A respiratory virus was found in 401/1055 (38.0%) samples. HCoV-NL63 was detected in 9/1055 (0.85%) with peak activity during autumn (67%). Most patients had a diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (6/9; 67%). Conclusions: This is the first report of HCoV-NL63 infections in hospitalised children in Africa. During the 2-year period HCoVNL63 played a minor role in ARI in children. © 2008 The Author Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
