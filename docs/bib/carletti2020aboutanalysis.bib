In this paper a phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis was applied to the virus identified in the first two subjects diagnosed in Italy with 2019-nCoV infection, recently renamed SARS-CoV-2(2) , two Chinese spouses arrived in Italy for tourism. The diagnosis was performed by the virology team under direction of Maria R. Capobianchi, at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INMI) in Rome, Italy, where the patients are currently hospitalized. This article is protected by copyright. },
