All major cities around the globe are in lockdown. In Pakistan the first case was diagnosed on 26 Feb 2020 and currently there are more than 1500 diagnosed cases and 12 deaths. Across the country there are a further 12,000 suspected cases. This will undoubtedly increase if precautionary measures are not taken. Pakistani universities, colleges and schools were in lockdown.
