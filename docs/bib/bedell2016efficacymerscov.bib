    abstract = {Â© 2016 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. Efficient and automated methods of disinfecting surfaces contaminated with the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may prevent the spread of the virus. Here we report the efficacy and use of an automated triple-emitter whole room UV-C disinfection system to inactivate mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59) and MERS-CoV viruses on surfaces with a >5 log10 reduction.},
