    abstract = {A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids (aa) 15-28 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3a protein was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. This anti-3a N-terminal antibody could detect 3a protein in infected cells, as did an anti-3a C-terminal antibody previously described. The latter targeted the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 3a (aa 134-274). The anti-3a N-terminal antibody could detect intracellular 3a as well as 3a expressed on the cell surface. Interestingly, only the anti-3a N-terminal antibody can inhibit SARS-CoV propagation in Vero E6 culture although the binding affinity of the anti-3a N-terminal antibody was lower than the anti-3a C-terminal antibody. © 2006 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},
