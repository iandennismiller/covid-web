    abstract = {The study presented here was conducted to evaluate the performance of a double-antigen sandwich ELISA to detect antibodies in human serum against the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A recombinant partial nucleocapsid protein of SARS-associated coronavirus was used as a serodiagnostic antigen in the ELISA. A total of 2892 clinical serum samples were tested with the ELISA kit, which positively identified 25 of 35 (71.4%) samples of patients with confirmed SARS infection, 286 of 407 (70%) samples of patients suspected of having SARS, 229 of 302 (75.8%) samples of convalescent SARS patients, and 0 of 544 samples obtained from healthcare workers; only 1 of 1604 clinical samples obtained from patients with other diseases demonstrated a weakly positive result. These results indicate that the double-antigen sandwich ELISA is an effective screening method for the serodiagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus. Â© Springer-Verlag 2005.},
