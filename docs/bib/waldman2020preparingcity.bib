    abstract = {Beginning in December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), began spreading rapidly throughout China and now is a global pandemic with cases reported in over 192 countries and territories worldwide. Clinically, COVID-19 ranges from a mild, self-limiting respiratory illness to severe progressive pneumonia and multiorgan failure. The first COVID-19 case was reported at the beginning of March in New York City (NYC), and now just three weeks later, NYC and its suburbs have over 5% of global cases. Worldwide, there is a rapid increase in the number of cases daily, including the number of patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care support.},
