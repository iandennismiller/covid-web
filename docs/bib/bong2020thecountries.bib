    abstract = {COVID-19 is spreading rapidly around the world with devastating consequences on patients, healthcare workers, health systems and economies. As it reaches low and middle-income countries, its effects could be even more dire because it will be difficult for them to respond aggressively to the pandemic. There is a great shortage of all health care providers who will be at risk due to a lack of personal protection equipment. Social distancing will be almost impossible. The necessary resources to treat patients will be in short supply. The end result could be a catastrophic loss of life. A global effort will be required to support faltering economies and health care systems.},
