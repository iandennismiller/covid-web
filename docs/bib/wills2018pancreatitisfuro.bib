    abstract = {Copyright 2018 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal ScienceA 1-y-old spayed female ferret (Mustela putorius furo) was referred for additional diagnostic evaluation after physical examination by the referring veterinarian revealed a cranial abdominal mass. The ferret had a 2-wk history of inappetence, weight loss, and lethargy. On presentation, the ferret was thin, and an approximately 3-cm mass was palpable in the cranial abdomen. No other abnormalities were noted. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a soft-tissue structure, with a moderate blood supply and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspirates of the mass were nondiagnostic. Exploratory laparotomy revealed multiple nodules and thickened tissues throughout the mesentery, a thickened and nodular pancreas, and a small amount of free abdominal fluid. Histopathology of mesenteric, lymphatic, and pancreatic biopsies revealed suppurative pancreatitis and necrotizing and pyogranulomatous mesenteric steatitis. Positive immunohistochemistry for feline coronavirus confirmed a diagnosis of ferret systemic coronavirus disease (FSCD). The ferret was treated medically with oral prednisolone, improved dramatically, and was still doing well 22 mo after diagnosis. Although FSCD has been reported extensively, this case is noteworthy for the presence of suppurative pancreatitis and the positive long-term outcome after corticosteroid therapy.},
