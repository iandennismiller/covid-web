    abstract = {Background: PDCoV (Porcine Deltacoronavirus) is a novel porcine coronavirus that causes intestinal necrosis of piglets, thinning of the intestinal wall and severe villus atrophy in the small intestine. PDCoV is a highly contagious infectious disease characterized by diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting. It has been reported that lncRNA has a significant effect on viral replication and increased or decreased virulence. At present, there is almost no research on lncRNA related to PDCoV infection. With the development of the research, a large number of lncRNAs related to PDCoV infection have been discovered. Identifying the role of these lncRNAs in the infection process facilitates the screening of diagnostically significant biomarkers. Results: Using high throughput sequencing to screen differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) during PDCoV infection, we identified 99, 41 and 33 differentially expressed lncRNAs in the early, middle and late stages of infection, respectively. These lncRNAs were involved in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, histidine metabolism and pentose and Chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation pathway. We obtained expression data of miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs during PDCoV infection and constructed and investigated an interaction network. The qRT-PCR validation results of 6 differentially expressed lncRNAs were consistent with RNA-Seq results. Conclusions: This study is the first to examine differentially expressed lncRNAs after PDCoV infection of piglets. These results can provide new insights into PDCoV infection and antiviral strategies.},
