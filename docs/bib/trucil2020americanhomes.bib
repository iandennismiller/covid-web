The AGS continues to review guidance set forth in peer-reviewed articles and editorials, as well as ongoing and updated guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other key agencies. This brief is based on the situation and any federal guidance/actions as of April 4, 2020. It is focused on NHs and other LTCFs, given their essential role in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
