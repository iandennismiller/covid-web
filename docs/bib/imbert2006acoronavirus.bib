    abstract = {In (+) RNA coronaviruses, replication and transcription of the giant ∼30 kb genome to produce genome- and subgenome-size RNAs of both polarities are mediated by a cognate membrane-bound enzymatic complex. Its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rd. Rp) activity appears to be supplied by non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) that includes an Rd. Rp domain conserved in all RNA viruses. Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second Rd. Rp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5′-(G/U)CC-3′ trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of <6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C-terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of Rd. Rps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus Rd. Rps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 Rd. Rp and cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 Rd. Rp produces primers utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 Rd. Rp. © 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization | },
