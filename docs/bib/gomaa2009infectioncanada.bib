    abstract = {Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) is an important viral pathogen causing diarrhoea of young turkey poults that is associated with sizeable economic losses for the turkey industry. Using a field isolate that was found to be free from turkey astrovirus and avian reovirus we were able to reproduce the clinical disease associated with TCoV. Clinical signs and weight gain of poults during experimental infections were compared with age-matched, uninfected controls. Poults infected at 2 days of age had 100% morbidity and 10% mortality, and birds infected at 28 days of age showed 75% morbidity and no mortality. Diarrhoea was consistently seen in infected poults at 2 to 3 days post infection (d.p.i.) with a duration of about 3 to 5 days. Mean body weights of birds infected at 2 or 28 days of age were significantly reduced compared with uninfected birds by 7 d.p.i. and remained significantly lower for the duration of the study. At 44 days of age, poults infected at 2 or 28 days of age weighed only 68.1% or 77.7%, respectively, compared with uninfected turkeys of the same age on the same diet, a mean difference in body weights of 683 or 477g, respectively. Infected birds had profound villus atrophy with some compensatory crypt hyperplasia at 5 to 7 d.p.i. Villus heights in the duodenum were significantly reduced at 7 d.p.i. We were able to reproduce enteric disease using only a pathogenic field isolate (MG10) of TCoV that negatively affected growth performance and intestinal morphology of young turkey poults.
