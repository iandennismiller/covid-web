Introduction: In the past five years, there have been 1,936 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 27 countries, with a mortality rate of 35.6%. Most cases have arisen in the Middle East, particularly the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, however there was a large hospital-associated outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015. Exposure to dromedary camels has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a risk factor in primary cases, but the exact mechanisms of transmission are not clear. Rigorous application of nationally defined infection prevention and control measures has reduced the levels of healthcare facility-associated outbreaks. There is currently no approved specific therapy or vaccine available. Areas covered: This review presents an overview of MERS-CoV within the last five years, with a particular emphasis on the key areas of transmission, infection control and prevention, and therapies and vaccines. Expert commentary: MERS-CoV remains a significant threat to public health as transmission mechanisms are still not completely understood. There is the potential for mutations that could increase viral transmission and/or virulence, and zoonotic host range. The high mortality rate highlights the need to expedite well-designed randomized clinical trials for direct, effective therapies and vaccines.},
