    abstract = {The sequence of the spike (also called peplomer or E2) protein gene of the Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was obtained from cDNA clones of genomic RNA. The gene sequence predicts a 150,825 mol wt apoprotein of 1363 amino acids having an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence of 17 amino acids, 19 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic anchor sequence of approximately 17 amino acids near the C terminus, and a hydrophilic cysteinerich C terminus of 35 amino acids. An internal Lys. ArgArg. SerArg. Arg sequence predicts a protease cleavage site between amino acids 768 and 769 that would separate the S apoprotein into S1 and S2 segments of 85690 and 65153 mol wt, respectively. Amino terminal amino acid sequencing of the virion-derived gp100 spike subunit confirmed the location of the predicted cleavage site, and established that gp120 and gp100 are the glycosylated virion forms of the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. Sequence comparisons between BCV and the antigenically related mouse hepatitis coronavirus revealed more sequence divergence in the putative knob region of the spike protein (S1) than in the stem region (S2).
