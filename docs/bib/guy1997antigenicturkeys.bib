    abstract = {A turkey coronavirus (TCV [NC95]) was characterized by antigenic comparison with other avian and mammalian coronaviruses using immunofluorescence (FA) and immunoperoxidase (IP)procedures. Based on FA and IP procedures, TCV (NC95) was determined to be antigenically indistinguishable from turkey enteric (bluecomb) coronavirus (TECV). In addition, TCV (NC95) and TECV were found to be closely related to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV); a one-way antigenic relationship was demonstrated. Polyclonal anti-bodies specific for TECV and IBV reacted strongly against TCV (NC95), as determined by FA procedures. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for IBV matrix protein (MAb 919) reacted strongly against TCV (NC95) and TECV as determined by FA and IP procedures; an IBV peplomer protein-specific MAb (MAb 94) did not recognize the two viruses. These studies suggest an identification of TCV (NC95) as a strain of TECV, and provide evidence of a close antigenic relationship between these viruses and IBV.},
