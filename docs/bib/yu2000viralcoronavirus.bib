    abstract = {Intestinal samples from turkey poults affected with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) were examined for viruses by immune electron microscopy and double-stranded RNA virus genome electropherotyping. Turkey coronavirus (TCV), avian rotaviruses, reovirus, and a yet undefined small round virus (SRV) were detected. The SRV and TCV were isolated and propagated in turkey embryos. Challenge of specific-pathogen-free turkey poults with SRV, TCV, or both resulted in mortality and clinical responses similar to those of natural PEMS. Our experiments indicate that SRV and TCV are possibly important agents in the etiology of PEMS and the combination of these infections might result in outbreaks with high mortality. The severity of clinical signs and mortality of PEMS are postulated to be partly related to the virus agents involved in individual outbreaks.},
