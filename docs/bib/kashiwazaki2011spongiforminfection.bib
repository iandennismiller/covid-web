    abstract = {Soluble receptor-resistant mutant 7 (ssr7) is isolated from a highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHMV cl-2 strain (cl-2). srr7 exhibits lower virulence than its maternal strain in infected mice, which is typically manifested in a longer lifespan. In this study, during the course of infection with srr7, small spongiotic lesions became apparent at 2days post-inoculation (pi), they spread out to form spongiform encephalopathy by 8 to 10days pi. We recently reported that the initial expressions of viral antigens in the brain are detected in the infiltrating monocyte lineage and in ependymal cells. Here, we demonstrate that the next viral spread was observed in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells or nestin-positive progenitor cells which take up positions in the subventricular zone (SVZ). From this restricted site of infection in the SVZ, a large area of gliosis extended deep into the brain parenchyma where no viral antigens were detected but vacuolar degeneration started at 48h pi of the virus. The extremely short incubation period compared with other experimental models of infectious spongiform degeneration in the brain would provide a superior experimental model to investigate the mechanism of spongiotic lesions formation.
