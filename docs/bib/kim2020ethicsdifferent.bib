    abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic raises difficult ethical questions for our healthcare system and its providers. Perhaps the most difficult is how to fairly distribute scarce resources, such as ICU beds and ventilators, as the answer will determine who lives and who dies. Compounding the difficulty, all of us are experiencing the dizzying newness of our socially distanced lives, and we sense that 'things are different now.' How do our traditional ethical principles apply to these very novel circumstances?},
