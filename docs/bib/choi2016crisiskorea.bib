    abstract = {Â© 2016 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. A Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak occurred in Korea between June 20 and July 28, 2015. A total of 186 patients were confirmed as being infected with MERS-CoV, 36 of whom died. Infection control nurses referred to hospital guidelines to address the screening and isolation needs of patients and instigated a variety of infection control activities to prevent MERS-CoV transmission at the frontlines of patient care. Their concerted effort is believed to have been instrumental in ending the outbreak.},
