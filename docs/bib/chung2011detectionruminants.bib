    abstract = {Five coronaviruses (Co. Vs) were detected in diarrheal feces from four zoo ruminant species: one wisent (Bison bonasus), two Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), one sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), and one nyala (Tragelaphus angasii). We sequenced and analyzed the spike (S) and hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) genes of these viruses and compared the nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences with those of other bovine CoV (BcoV) strains. Comparison of the entire deduced aa sequences of the S and HE glycoproteins revealed no specific differences that would account for discrimination between bovine-like CoV strains from zoo ruminants and Bco. Vs strains. In addition, the 99.9% aa identity among the five CoV strains revealed that the ruminants were infected by the same strain. Phylogenetically, bovine-like Co. Vs belong to group 2a Co. Vs, which are related most closely to the BcoV strains recently isolated in Korea. These data suggest that cattle are potential reservoirs for Co. Vs that are capable of infecting zoo ruminants. },
