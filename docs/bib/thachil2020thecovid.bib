    abstract = {Coagulopathy in corona virus infection has been shown to be associated with high mortality with high D-dimers being a particularly important marker for the coagulopathy.(1) In the latest paper from the same group, the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin was shown to decrease mortality as well. (2) This is especially so in patients i) who have met the sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria >/=4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029) compared to those with SIC score <4 (29.0% vs 22.6%, P=0.419).or ii) with markedly elevated D-dimer (greater than six-fold at the upper limit of normal).},
