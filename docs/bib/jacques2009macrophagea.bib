    abstract = {A rapid antiviral immune response may be related to viral interaction with the host cell leading to activation of macrophages via pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) or specific viral receptors. Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus known to induce acute viral hepatitis in mice. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for the secretion of high-pathogenic MHV3-induced inflammatory cytokines. We report that the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in peritoneal macrophages does not depend on CEACAM1a, as demonstrated in cells isolated from Ceacam1a-/- mice. The induction of IL-6 and TNF-α production was related rather to the fixation of the spike (S) protein of MHV3 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regions enriched in heparan sulphate and did not rely on viral replication, as demonstrated with denatured S protein and UV-inactivated virus. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice but not in livers from Tlr2-/- mice. The histopathological observations were correlated with the levels of those inflammatory cytokines. Depending on mouse strain, the viral fixation to heparan sulfate/TLR2 stimulated differently the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α. These results suggest that TLR2 and heparan sulphate receptors can act as new viral PPRs involved in inflammatory responses. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
