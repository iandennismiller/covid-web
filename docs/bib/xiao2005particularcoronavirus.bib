    abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) belongs to coronavirus, however, it is dramatically different from all previously known coronaviruses. A peculiar character of RNA sequence is found in SARS, revealing particular symmetry in its sequencing. Comparison of symmetry between SARS and other coronaviruses shows heuristically that SARS coronavirus might come from the avian infectious bronchitis virus or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.
