    abstract = {© 2017 American Society for Microbiology. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease, caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV), that is characterized by atypical pneumonia. The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV plays an important role in inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) production via an unknown mechanism. In this study, the SARS-CoV N protein was found to bind to the SPRY domain of the tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby interfering with the association between TRIM25 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and inhibiting TRIM25- mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. Type I IFN production induced by poly I·C or Sendai virus (SeV) was suppressed by the SARS-CoV N protein. SARS-CoV replication was increased by overexpression of the full-length N protein but not N amino acids 1 to 361, which could not interact with TRIM25. These findings provide an insightful interpretation of the SARS-CoV-mediated host innate immune suppression caused by the N protein.},
