    abstract = {Current coronavirus pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus outbreak during the current century after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.(1) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an immunopathologic event and main cause of death following COVID-19. The main mechanism of ARDS is uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response and cytokine storm following release of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interferons (IFN), interleukines (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) and chemokines.(2-3) So, some Chinese researchers proposed or used anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment regimen of patients with COVID-19.(3-4).},
