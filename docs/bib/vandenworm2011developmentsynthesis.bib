    abstract = {The RNA replication and transcription complex of coronaviruses is associated with an elaborate reticulovesicular network (RVN) of modified endoplasmic reticulum. Using cycloheximide and puromycin, we have studied the effect of translation inhibition on the RNA synthesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus. Both inhibitors prevented the usual exponential increase in viral RNA synthesis, with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy indicating that RVN development came to a standstill. Nevertheless, limited RNA synthesis was supported, implying that continued translation is not an absolute requirement and suggesting a direct link between RVN formation and accumulation of coronavirus proteins. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},
