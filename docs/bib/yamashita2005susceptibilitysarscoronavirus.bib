    abstract = {Pathological characterization of autopsied tissues from patients with SARS revealed severe damage in restricted tissues, such as lung, with no apparent cell damage in other tissues, such as intestine and brain. Here, we examined the susceptibility of neural cell lines of human (OL) and rat (C6) origins to SARS-associated coronavirus. Both of the neural cell lines showed no apparent cytopathic effects (CPE) by infection but produced virus with infectivity of 102-5 per ml, in sharp contrast to the production by infected Vero E6 cells of >109 per ml that showed a lytic infection with characteristic rounding CPE. Interestingly, the infection of intestinal cell line Ca. Co-2 also induced no apparent CPE, with production of the virus at a slightly lower level as that of the Vero E6 cell culture. Notably, the cellular receptor for the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was expressed at similar levels on Vero E6 and Ca. Co-2 cells, but at undetectable levels on OL and C6 cells.
