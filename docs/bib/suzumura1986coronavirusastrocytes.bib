    abstract = {Infection of the central nervous system by mouse hepatitis virus stain A59, a murine neurotopic coronavirus, induces class I major histocompatibility complex antigens on mouse oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, cells that do not normally express these antigens on their surfaces. This induction, which occurs through soluble factors elaborated by infected glial cells, potentially allows immunocytes to interact with the glial cells and may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced, immune-mediated demyelination in the central nervous system.},
