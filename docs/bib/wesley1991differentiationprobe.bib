    abstract = {A plasmid, pG3BS, containing a cDNA clone from the 5′ coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein gene appears to be specific for enteric transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains and for live-attenuated TGEV vaccines. This cDNA probe is used to differentiate porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) isolates from TGEV field and vaccine strains by a slot blot hybridization assay. Probe pG3BS also hybridizes to canine coronavirus (CCV) RNA but does not hybridize to antigenically related feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) RNA. The RNAs of 13 enteric TGEV isolates from the United States, Japan, and England, 4 US-licensed live-attenuated TGEV vaccines, and antigenically closely related CCV were detected by pG3BS. The RNAs of FIPV and 3 US isolates of PRCV did not react with pG3BS but were detected by a TGEV-derived plasmid, pRP3. Pigs infected with either PRCV or TGEV test serologically positive for TGEV antibody by the serum neutralization test. Characterization of the virus circulating in a swine herd by the pG3BS probe will differentiate between an enteric TGEV and a respiratory PRCV infection. © 1991, American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians. },
