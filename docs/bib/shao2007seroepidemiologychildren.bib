    abstract = {Background: Recently, several new human coronaviruses have been identified. Objectives: To define the seroepidemiology of group I human coronaviruses. Study design: A recombinant protein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on portions of the nucleocapsid protein of group I human coronaviruses was developed and was used to screen serum from 243 children and young adults. Results: For HCoV-229E, the percentages of seropositive individuals were 57.1% for infants <2 months old; 38.9% for infants 2-3 months old; 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old; 42.9-50.0% for infants 6-12 months old; 34.8-62.5% for individuals 1-20 years old. For HCoV-NL63, the percentages of seropositive individuals were 45.2% for infants <2 months old; 11.1% for infants 2-3 months old; 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old; 28.6-40.0% for infants 6-12 months old; 25.0-70.3% for individuals 1-20 years old. Conclusions: Infection with these viruses is common in childhood though the prevalence of these viruses may vary from year to year. },
