    abstract = {The presence of subgenomic mRNAs in virions of IBV was examined by probing Northern blots of RNA extracted from virions using as a probe a cDNA of the 3'-terminal nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. This detects all five mRNAs because of the 3'-coterminal, nested-set arrangement of coronavirus mRNAs. The mRNAs were readily detected even after extensive purification of virions and after RNase A treatment of virions. In sucrose gradients the peaks of virus particles, genomic RNA (gRNA), and mRNAs were coincident. Cellular mRNA was not detected in virions. The molar ratio of gRNA to each mRNA ranged from about 10 to 30 for IBV-Beaudette and 25 to 800 for IBV-M41. The molar ratio of genomic to intracellular viral mRNAs was also determined. From this it was estimated that the efficiency of incorporation of gRNA into virions was at least 20- to 100-fold greater, depending on the mRNA species, for IBV-Beaudette and 100- to 500-fold for IBV-M41. It is concluded that most virions contain only gRNA or contain only one species of mRNA on average in addition to gRNA. Â© 1993 Academic Press.},
