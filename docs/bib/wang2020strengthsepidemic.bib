    abstract = {This study used the Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O) and Threats (T) (SWOT) analysis method, drawing on our experience of the response to the 2003 SARS epidemic, the 2019 China Health Statistics Yearbook data, and changes in China's policy environment for the pneumonia epidemic response relating to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, to perform a systematic analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control strategy S, W, O, and T, with a further analysis of a strategic foundation and to determine a significant and relative strategy. We assessed and formulated strength-opportunity (SO), weakness-opportunity (WO), strength-threat (ST), and weakness-threat (WT) strategies for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. We conducted an in-depth analysis and identified the highest-priority policies. These are: reshaping the emergency system (SO1); adding health emergency departments to universities and other institutions (WO2); adjusting the economic structure and strengthening international and domestic linkages (ST2); and strengthening public intervention in responding to public health emergencies (WT1).},
