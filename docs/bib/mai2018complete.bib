    abstract = {Â© 2018 Mai et al. We report here the amplification and sequence analysis of two complete genomes of newly emerged porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains, isolated from diarrhea samples from piglets in Guangdong Province in southern China. These genomes provide further sequence data for evaluating the relationships among PDCo. Vs from different countries.},
