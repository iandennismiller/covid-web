    abstract = {On March 13th, the United States (US) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic a national emergency. By March 18(th) , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 had spread to all 50 US states, with 7,038 cases and 97 deaths.(1) The trajectory of cases mirrors that of Italy, where doctors are forced to consider who is more deserving of a ventilator.(2) In response, social distancing measures are being promoted across the US in the hopes of slowing the growth in new cases, i.e. "flattening the curve." This could maintain the demand for acute care within the healthcare system's capacity to treat.(3) Travel has been curtailed, conferences and concerts cancelled, and schools and universities have moved students off campus and classes online. Medical schools are following suit, with added motivators. In canceling classes and rotations, medical schools hope to: promote social distancing, limit the risk of students contracting the virus, limit the number of healthcare workers who might spread the virus to unaffected patients, minimize the teaching burden on frontline providers, and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) for essential personnel. These are logical reasons for removing students from hospitals. But, despite our best efforts, there may come a point in the US when, as is set to happen in Italy, medical demand outpaces medical capacity.(2) If the same happens here, is there a plan in place for incorporating senior medical students into emergency relief efforts?},
