    abstract = {Here we analyzed the gene expression profile of cells that stably express the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3a protein to determine its effects on host functions. A lung epithelial cell-line, A549, was chosen for this study because the lung is the primary organ infected by SARS-CoV and fatalities resulted mainly from pulmonary complications. Our results showed that the expression of 3a up-regulates the mRNA levels of all three subunits, Aγ, Bβ, and γ, of fibrinogen. Consequently, the intracellular levels as well as the secretion of fibrinogen were increased. We also observed increased fibrinogen levels in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.
