    abstract = {The effect of host immune status on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here, we report the first case of COVID-19 with HIV-1 and HCV co-infection, who showed a persistently negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test, but delayed antibody response in the plasma. This case highlights the influence of HIV-1-induced immune dysfunction on the early SARS-CoV-2 clearance.},
