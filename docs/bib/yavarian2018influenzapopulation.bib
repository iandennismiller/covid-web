    abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. Background: The pilgrimage to Mecca and Karbala bring many Muslims to a confined area. Respiratory tract infections are the most common diseases transmitted during mass gatherings in Hajj, Umrah and Karbala. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza virus infections among Iranian general population and pilgrims with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) returning from Mecca and Karbala during 2013–2016. Methods: During 2013–2016, a total of 42351 throat swabs were examined for presence of influenza viruses and MERS-CoV in Iranian general population and pilgrims returning from Mecca and Karbala with SARI by using one step RT-PCR kit. Results: None of the patients had MERS-CoV but influenza viruses were detected in 12.7% with high circulation of influenza A/H1N1 (47.1%). Conclusion: This study showed the prevalence of influenza infections among Iranian pilgrims and general population and suggests continuing surveillance, infection control and appropriate vaccination especially nowadays that the risk of influenza pandemic threatens the world, meanwhile accurate screening for MERS-CoV is also recommended.},
