    abstract = {Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses and infect a lot of species of mammals and birds. Five coronaviruses currently infect humans: HCo. Vs 229E and OC43, identified in the 1960s, SARS-CoV identified in March 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and the HCo. Vs NL63 and HKU1, identified in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The genome of the coronaviruses is a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 30 kb. The evolution of these viruses occurs through some features: the generation of multiple mutants during the replication resulting on a quasispecies structure of the viral population, the demonstrated ability of coronaviruses to establish persistent infections, the flexibility of the genome due to a high frequency of homologue or heterologue recombinations, the ability to jump barrier species and to adapt to the new environment. Two epidemiologic pictures of HCoV infections have to be distinguished: as suggested by recent studies, HCo. Vs except SARS-CoV, are distributed worldwide and cocirculate during seasonal outbreaks. The distribution of the different HCoV species varies according to the geographic area and season. In contrast, the SARS-CoV is responsible of the first emerging infectious disease of this millennium, infecting more than 8000 people between November 2002 and July 2003. Its circulation has been stopped by drastic public health policy. Human coronaviruses may be also involved in enteric and neurologic diseases. The detection of these viruses is difficult and mainly based on molecular assays (RT-PCR). There is no established specific therapy to date. Â© 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. },
