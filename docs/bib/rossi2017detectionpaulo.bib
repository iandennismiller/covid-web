    abstract = {Neonatal diarrhea can be a consequence of bacterial, endoparasite and viral infections. Although virus involved in diarrhea is frequently studied in cattle herds, there is lack of studies in Brazilian buffalo herds. The aim of this study was evaluate the presence of rotavirus and coronavirus in diarrhea samples of buffaloes (Bubalus buballis) raised on eight farms in Pariquera-açu, Registro, Pirassununga, Dourado, São João da Boa Vista e Congonhas, State of São Paulo, Brazil. We collected 40 diarrhea samples from water buffalo calves. While coronavirus was detected using nested polymerase chain reaction, rotavirus was detected using Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) with silver stain. Rotavirus was not detected, while two samples (2/40, 5.0%) were positive for coronavirus. Although we did not detect rotavirus, a low percentage of coronavirus was observed; possible interference of these viruses in the development of diarrhea should not be discarded. Considering the lack of literature about diarrhea in water buffalo calves, particularly the one related with coronavirus, our results encourage new studies to enhance buffalo health in our country.},
