    abstract = {In order to determine highly immunogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epitope peptides capable of inducing long-lasting immunity, we first screened immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies reactive to 197 different overlapping 15-mers from the SARS-CoV proteins in the sera of three infected patients. Forty-two peptides among them were reactive to the sera from all three patients. Consequently, we tested for the reactivity of these 42 peptides to patients' sera (n = 45) at 6-month post-infection. The significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies specific to three (S791, M207 and N161) of 42 peptides were detectable in the post-infection sera from 23 (51%), 27 (60%) and 19 (42%) of 45 patients, respectively. These three peptides, recognized by their long-lasting immunity, may provide a better understanding of the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV.},
