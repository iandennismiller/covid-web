    abstract = {Fifty-five of 66 (83%) coyote pups from bitches vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV) were seropositive for CPV antibodies at birth. The CPV antibody titer in the pups declined with a half-life of 6.7 days until by the 8th week, only two of 41 (5%) pups were seropositive for CPV antibodies. At 8 wk, 41 of the pups were vaccinated against CPV (killed feline origin vaccine), but only one of 37 (3%) was positive for CPV antibodies at 11 wk. The 8-wk-old pups were either too young to respond to the CPV vaccine; they had sufficient undetectable, maternally-derived CPV antibodies to block active immunization; 3 wk was not a sufficient time for an immunological response from the pups; or the vaccine was poorly antigenic. Twenty of the 66 pups (30%) were seropositive for canine coronavirus (CCV) antibodies at birth, and all but three of the 20 were whelped from bitches that were also seropositive for CCV antibodies. Vaccination of females prior to whelping appeared to provide protection to their pups from CPV-induced mortality.},
