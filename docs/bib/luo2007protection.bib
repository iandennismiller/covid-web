    abstract = {To warrant potential clinical testing, the equine anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) F(ab′)2 requires evaluation in as many animal models as possible. In this study, we established a new animal model, the Chinese hamster, susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV could propagate effectively and sustain high levels for 1 wk in animal lungs. All animals were protected from SARS-CoV infection in preventive settings. Further, when used therapeutically this antibody led to an approximately 4-log10 decrease in viral burden in infected animal lungs. The pathological changes in lungs correlated closely with the dose of antibody administered. The excellent preventive and therapeutic roles of equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab′)2 in several animal models, including the novel Chinese hamster model described in this study, have provided exciting data concerning its potential clinical study. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},
