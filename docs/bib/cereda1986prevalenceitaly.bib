    abstract = {A seroepidemiological study for detection of antibody to human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus (NCDCV), has been carried out using sera collected from hospitalized patients or healthy persons through routine laboratory tests in Northern Italy. Patients tested were children and adults with different pathological diseases. Antibody detection was performed by using an indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique (for all viruses) and, in the case of OC43 and NCDCV, antibody detection was obtained even with a hemagglutination inhibition test and a plaque reduction neutralization assay. Results obtained show a significant difference in the prevalence of antibody to 229E between children and adult group. Furthermore, a different titer was observed, within the two groups, between patients affected by hematological diseases (leukemia) and patients with other diseases. Finally, our data seem to confirm previous studies reporting a very high prevalence of antibody to coronavirus OC43 but a less detectable seropositivity to coronavirus 229E.
