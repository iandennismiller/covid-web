    abstract = {The membrane (M) proteins of murine coronavirus (MHV) strains have been reported to contain only O-linked oligosaccharides. The predicted O-glycosylation site consisting of four amino acid residues of Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr is located immediately adjacent to the initiator Met and is well conserved among MHV strains investigated so far. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of a highly virulent strain MHV-2 M-coding region and demonstrated that MHV-2 had a unique amino acid, Asn, at position 2 at the conserved O-glycosylation site. We also demonstrated that this substitution added N-linked glycans to MHV-2 M protein resulting in increment of molecular mass of MHV-2 M protein compared with JHM strain having only O-linked glycans.
