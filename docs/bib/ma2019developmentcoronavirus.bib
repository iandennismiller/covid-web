    abstract = {Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which was associated with severe diarrhea disease in pigs. SADS-CoV was first detected and identified as the causative agent of a devastating swine disease outbreak in southern China in 2017. Routine monitoring and early detection of the source of infection is therefore integral to the prevention and control of SADS-CoV infection. In this study, a SYBR green-based real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique was established for rapid detection and monitoring of this emerging virus. Specific primers were designed based on the conserved region within the M gene of the viral genome. The lowest detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay was 10 copies/Î¼L. This assay was specific and had no cross-reaction with other 11 swine viruses. The positive rate of 84 clinical samples for the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR and the conventional RT-PCR was 73.81% (62/84) and 53.57% (45/84), respectively. These results demonstrated that the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR technique was an effectively diagnostic method with higher sensitivity than probe-based RT-qPCR and gel-based RT-PCR for detection and epidemiological investigations of SADS-CoV.},
