    abstract = {Tilorone is a 50-year-old synthetic small-molecule compound with antiviral activity that is proposed to induce interferon after oral administration. This drug is used as a broad-spectrum antiviral in several countries of the Russian Federation. We have recently described activity in vitro and in vivo against the Ebola Virus. After a broad screening of additional viruses, we now describe in vitro activity against Chikungunya virus (CHIK) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).},
