    abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoV) mature by a budding process at intracellular membranes. Here we showed that the major surface protein S of a porcine CoV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) is not transported to the cell surface but is retained intracellularly. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that a tyrosine-dependent signal (YXXI) in the cytoplasmic tail is essential for intracellular localization of the S protein. Surface expression of mutant proteins was evident by immunofluorescence analysis and surface biotinylation. Intracellularly retained S proteins only contained endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans, whereas mutant proteins that migrated to the plasma membrane acquired N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type. Corresponding tyrosine residues are present in the cytoplasmic tails of the S proteins of other animal CoV but not in the tail portion of the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. Changing the SEPV tetrapeptide in the cytoplasmic tail to YEPI resulted in intracellular retention of the S protein of SARS-CoV. As the S proteins of CoV have receptor binding and fusion activities and are the main target of neutralizing antibodies, the differences in the transport behavior of the S proteins suggest different strategies in the virus host interactions between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses.},
