    abstract = {A novel swine acute diarrhea syndrome Coronavirus (SADS-CoV) that causes severe diarrhea in suckling piglets was identified in southern China in 2017. A simple and rapid detection test was developed for this virus using real-time RT-LAMP based on the conserved N gene of the virus. The method had a detection limit of 1.0 × 101 copies/μL with no cross-reactions with classical swine fever virus, porcine and respiratory syndrome virus NA, porcine and respiratory syndrome virus EU, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, foot and mouth disease virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL), swine influenza virus subtype H1N1, porcine circovirus type 2, seneca valley virus, porcine parvovirus, porcine deltacoronavirus and rotavirus. This method was also reproducible. Twenty of 24 clinical samples were identified as SADS-CoV RNA-positive by the real-time RT-LAMP and the results were consistent with that of the real time RT-PCR method. This new method for detecting SADS-CoV is specific and sensitive for the detection of SADS-CoV.},
