    abstract = {Â© 2015, American Society for Microbiology. The emerging porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) requires trypsin supplementation to activate its S protein for membrane fusion and virus propagation in cell culture. By substitution of a single amino acid in the S protein, we created a recombinant PEDV with an artificial furin protease cleavage site N terminal of the putative fusion peptide (PEDV-S<sup>FCS</sup>). PEDV-S<sup>FCS</sup> exhibited trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion and was able to replicate in culture cells independently of trypsin, though to low titer.},
