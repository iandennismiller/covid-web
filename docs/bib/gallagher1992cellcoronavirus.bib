    abstract = {The cellular receptors for a coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have been recently identified as one or more members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family. The neurotropic JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) possesses a highly fusogenic surface (S) glycoprotein. This protein is now shown to promote the spread of MHV into cells lacking the specific CEA-related MHV receptor. Resistant cells are recruited into MHV-induced syncytium with consequent production of progeny virus. Cell-to-cell spread of virus via membrane fusion without the requirement for specific cell surface receptor offers a novel way for virus to spread within infected hosts. Â© 1992.},
