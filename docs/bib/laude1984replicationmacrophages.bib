    abstract = {Several strains of the enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) have been shown to replicate in alveolar macrophages maintained in vitro. A distinct cytopathic effect was observed at a multiplicity of infection â‰¥0.1. Infected cells released infectious virus. The extent of both virus production and cell destruction was highly dependent upon the virus input. At low input, cell viability was affected only slightly, and a delayed and persistent virus production could be observed. TGEV infection of macrophages also led to a marked synthesis of type I interferon. Thus, the possibility that alveolar macrophages act as an extra-intestinal target for TGEV must be considered.},
