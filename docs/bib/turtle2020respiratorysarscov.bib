    abstract = {Many viruses can occasionally gain entry into the human central nervous system (CNS), even if most of the disease they cause does not involve the CNS. In a recent review, Li and colleagues (J Med Virol doi: 10.1002/jmv.25728) propose that SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can enter the human CNS, based upon the observation that a number of patients need mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory failure. However, respiratory failure caused by pneumonia is clinically distinct from that caused by brain failure. The published clinical features of COVID-19 do not suggest that involvement of the CNS is common. The possibility of CNS entry by SARS-CoV-2 remains plausible, but unproven.
