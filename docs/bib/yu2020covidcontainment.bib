    abstract = {Since the first report on the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December, 2019,(1) there have been 78 064 cases have been confirmed and 2715 deaths as of February 25, 2020. For any infectious disease, there are three kinds of way to control the epidemic of infectious disease-that is, to control the source of infection, to cut off transmission routes, and to protect the susceptible population. As a new infectious disease, it is difficult to develop a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 in a short period of time. So, it is not possible to protect susceptible population at present. Social distancing is one of the main ways to cut off transmission routes - people cannot pass on infection if they do not come into contact with other people. Based on the understanding that COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, there has been widespread use of face masks in Wuhan.},
