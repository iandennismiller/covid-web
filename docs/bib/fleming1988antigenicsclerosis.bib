    abstract = {Many studies have either supported or discounted the role of coronaviruses as etiologic agents in multiple sclerosis (MS). Two new approaches were applied to investigate this controversy. First, monoclonal antibodies specific for either murine coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis viruses) or human coronaviruses were used to characterize the antigenic features of MS-derived coronaviruses SK and SD. Both isolates were found to have a mouse hepatitis virus-type profile. Second, serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies to different coronaviruses, including SD, were measured in MS and control groups. No significant difference in antibody level to coronaviruses was found between MS and control samples. The results of these antigenic studies do not support a specific association between MS and coronaviruses. Â© 1988, Arch Neurol. },
