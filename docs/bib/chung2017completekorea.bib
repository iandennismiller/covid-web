    abstract = {Â© 2017 Chung et al. Two porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains, named DH1/2016 and DH2/2016, were isolated from feces of piglets which had severe watery diarrhea symptoms. A comparison of the complete genome sequences suggested that the DH1/2016 and DH2/2016 strains are highly homologous to each other and to PDCo. Vs isolated in early 2014 from the United States.},
