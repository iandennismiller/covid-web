    abstract = {In our studies of murine coronavirus transcription, we continue to use defective interfering (DI) RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which we insert a transcription consensus sequence in order to mimic subgenomic RNA synthesis from the nondefective genome. Using our subgenomic DI system, we have studied the effects of sequences flanking the MHV transcription consensus sequence on subgenomic RNA transcription. We obtained the following results, (i) Insertion of a 12-nucleotide-long sequence including the UCUAAAC transcription consensus sequence at different locations of the DI RNA resulted in different efficiencies of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis. (ii) Differences in the amount of subgenomic DI RNA were defined by the sequences that flanked the 12-nucleotide-long sequence and were not affected by the location of the 12-nucleotide-long sequence on the DI RNA. (iii) Naturally occurring flanking sequences of intergenic sequences at gene 6-7, but not at genes 1-2 and 2-3, contained a transcription suppressive element(s). (iv) Each of three naturally occurring flanking sequences of an MHV genomic cryptic transcription consensus sequence from MHV gene 1 also contained a transcription suppressive element(s). These data showed that sequences flanking the transcription consensus sequence affected MHV transcription. Â© 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},
