    abstract = {Background Study of human coronavirus and other virus-associated respiratory illnesses is needed to describe their clinical effects on chronically ill, older adults. Methods A prospective study during 2009 to 2013 clinically assessed acute respiratory illnesses soon after onset and 3 to 4 weeks later in patients aged â‰¥60 years with chronic lung and heart diseases (group 1, 100 subjects) and healthy adults aged 18 to 40 years (group 2, 101 subjects). Respiratory secretions were tested for nucleic acids of a panel of respiratory viruses. An increase in antibody titer was assessed for 4 coronavirus strains. Results Virus-associated illnesses (29 [39.1%] of 74 illnesses in group 1 and 59 [48.7%] of 121 illnesses in group 2) occurred in all calendar quarters, most commonly in the first and fourth quarters. Coronaviruses (group 1: 14 [18.9%] illnesses; group 2: 26 [21.5%] illnesses) and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses (group 1: 14 [18.9%] illnesses; group 2: 37 [30.6%] illnesses) were most common. Virus co-infections occurred in 10 illnesses. Illnesses with 9 to 11 symptoms were more common in group 1 (17 [23.0%]) than in group 2 (15 [12.4%]) (P <.05). Compared with group 2, more group 1 subjects reported dyspnea, more severe disease of longer duration, and treatment for acute illness with prednisone and antibiotics. Coronavirus-associated illnesses (percent of illnesses, group 1 vs group 2) were characterized by myalgias (21% vs 68%, P <.01), chills (50% vs 52%), dyspnea (71% vs 24%, P <.01), headache (64% vs 72%), malaise (64% vs 84%), cough (86% vs 68%), sputum production (86% vs 60%), sore throat (64% vs 80%), and nasal congestion (93% vs 96%). Conclusions Respiratory illnesses were commonly associated with coronaviruses and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses affecting chronically ill, older patients more than healthy, young adults.},
