    abstract = {Four-hundred seventy-two sera were examined by the indirect immunofluorescence test against Coronavirus strain OC43 adapted to the HRT18 cell culture. Sera were from children and adults hospitalized over a 4-year period, from 1979 to 1982, at the CHRU of Clermont-Ferrand (France) for different clinical reasons. Of the 446 sera tested, 61 % showed antibodies against OC43; 90 % of adult sera were positive. Coronavirus infections are very common in France. Immunity appears early in life, and infection is frequent in children from 12–36 months of age. © 1987, Editions Scientifiques Elsevier, Paris. },
