    abstract = {As the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread across the world, and the associated lung disease COVID-19 remains difficult to treat, information from media and private communication flows at high speed, often through unfiltered channels.

This phenomenon was recently labelled as "infodemic" by the World Health Organization.},
