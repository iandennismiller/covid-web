    abstract = {The immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) technique has been used for the detection of a rabbit enteric coronavirus (RECV). Immune serum was prepared in guinea pigs; the viral antigen used for the immunization procedure was obtained from the caecum of a sick rabbit, concentrated by centrifugation and purified on Percoll gradient. In order to identify the viral particles used in the immunization procedure, the protein pattern of the particles was determined by electrophoresis and compared with the pattern of other known coronaviruses. Analysis of structural polypeptides of the purified viral particles revealed a pattern similar to that reported for other coronaviruses. These polypeptides cross reacted with two other coronavirus specific immune sera (IBV and TGE). IEM assay of fecal samples collected from healthy and sick rabbits showed the presence of immune aggregates in specimens from both sick and healthy rabbits. Those aggregates contained viral particules sharing morphological characteristics with other coronaviruses. Furthermore, IEM assay was shown to be more sensitive than a direct EM procedure to detect coronavirus particles in rabbit feces. This assay also allowed the detection of a larger number of chronic carriers. },
