    abstract = {A novel human Coronavirus (HCoV) was this year recognized as the etiological agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Two other HCoV (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) have been known for 30 years. HCoV-229E has been recently involved in nosocomial respiratory viral infections in high-risk children. However, their diagnosis is not routinely performed. Currently, reliable immunofluorescence and cell culture methodologies are not available. As part of a four-year epidemiological study in a Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive care unit, we have performed and demonstrated the reliability of a reverse transcription-PCR-hybridization assay to detect HCoV of the 229E antigenic group in 2028 clinical respiratory specimens. In hospitalized children (children and newborns) and staff members we found a high incidence of HcoV-229E infection. This reverse transcription-PCR-hybridization assay gave a high specificity and a sensitivity of 0.5 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose per ml. This technique is reliable and its application for screening large number of clinical samples would improve the diagnosis of HCo.
