    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Parker's Rat Coronavirus (PRCV) was studied in axenic CD rats. Three to four 9 to 10 week old rats were euthanized daily for eight days after intranasal inoculation. Rats remained free of clinical disease. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx and trachea after twenty-four hours and from the lung by day three but was not detected in respiratory tract after seven days. Viral antigen was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in the mucosal epithelium of upper respiratory tract and in pulmonary alveolar septae from day two to six postinoculation. Acute rhinitis developed by day two and was associated with mild focal necrosis of respiratory mucosal epithelium. Mild nonsuppurative tracheitis and multifocal interstitial pneumonia appeared by day five and persisted through day eight. Dacryoadenitis did not occur, sialoadenitis was detected in only three rats and virus was recovered from only one submaxillary salivary gland. This experiment indicates that PRCV can be a primary pathogen for the respiratory system of adult rats. In contrast to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus the tropism of PRCV for salivary and lacrimal glands is low. ",

Sera were studied by the complement fixation (CF) test, and a sharp outbreak of 229E- like virus infection was detected in the community in the spring of 1967. The serologic infection rate in a representative group of families, as determined by the combined results of both the CF and neutralization tests, was 34.0% during the periods studied. All segments of the population were affected. This virus tended to spread preferentially within families. Secondary cases were found in 17 of 26 families in which infection was detected; in all but one of the families in which the virus was introduced but did not spread, the single infection was in a person 15 years or older. Serologic evidence of infection was associated with an increased number of illnesses reported during February-April 1967; most of the illnesses were upper respiratory in character. The determination of CF and neutralizing antibody responses to 229E-like infection suggests that CF antibody to this virus remains elevated and detectable for a relatively short period of time after infection, while neutralizing antibody persists and remains detectable for a longer period of time than the CF antibody. The CF test may thus be used to detect infection with 229E virus if it is performed on sera collected shortly after infection, even in the absence of an acute-phase serum. The neutralization test may be used both to detect recent 229E infections and to determine an individual\u2019s past experience with this virus. \u00a9 1970 by the University of Chicago. ",

    "abstract": "The spike glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 mediates the early events leading to infection of cells, including fusion of the vital and cellular membranes. The spike is a type I membrane glycoprotein that possesses a conserved transmembrane anchor and an unusual cysteine-rich (cys) domain that bridges the putative junction of the anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. In this study, we examined the role of these carboxyl-terminal domains in spike-mediated membrane fusion. We show that the cytoplasmic tail is not required for fusion but has the capacity to enhance membrane fusion activity. Chimeric spike protein mutants containing substitutions of the entire transmembrane anchor and cys domain with the herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (gD-1) anchor demonstrated that fusion activity requires the presence of the A59 membrane-spanning domain and the portion of the cys domain that lies upstream of the cytoplasmic tail. The cys domain is a required element since its deletion from the wild-type spike protein abrogates fusion activity. However, addition of the cys domain to fusion- defective chimeric proteins was unable to restore fusion activity. Thus, the cys domain is necessary but is not sufficient to complement the gD-1 anchor and allow for membrane fusion. Site-specific mutations of conserved cysteine residues in the cys domain markedly reduce membrane fusion, which further supports the conclusion that this region is crucial for spike function. The results indicate that the carboxyl-terminus of the spike transmembrane anchor contains at least two distinct domains, both of which are necessary for full membrane fusion. ",

The lesions did not differ significantly with whether they were fed or fasted. The severity of the lesions in the intestinal epithelium was in decreasing order in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum. The lesions first appeared 24 hours postinoculation (PI) and progressed through 96 hours PI, as marked shortening of the villi, loss of microvilli, granular appearance of the cytoplasm of epithelial cells with nuclear margination of chromatin, and accentuation of the nucleolus. Similar lesions were observed in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum of turkey embryos inoculated at 24 days old as well as poults from these embryos. Signs of healing were first seen at 120 hours PI. No histopathological changes were observed in the pancreas, brain, kidneys, liver, adrenal, and bursa of Fabricius.

    "abstract": "The morphology and morphogenesis of virus strain LY-138 recovered from neonatal diarrheic calves were investigated by electron microscopy using negativestaining techniques and ultrathin sectioning. Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50-60 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70-80 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen. Release also occurred by digestion and lysis of extruded infected cells or by fusion of virus-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the apical plasmalemma and liberation of their contents. \u00a9 1976.",

    "abstract": "Seven conventional newborn calves were inoculated orally with the coronavirus strain LY\u2010138, originally recovered from naturally\u2010infected diarrheic calves. All calves developed diarrhea during the first 24 h after inoculation. The presence and excretion of virus was monitored by electron microscopy. Grossly, the changes were subtle and not striking. The intestinal tract was distended and contained a yellow clear fluid. The small intestinal wall was thin and transparent. Histologic changes were characterized by atrophy and fusion of the villi, decreased height and vacuolation of the intestinal epithelial cells, by a reduced number of goblet cells, crypt hypertrophy and dilatation, and by edema and increased cellularity of the lamina propria mucosae. Ultrastructurally the viral agent infected the intestinal absorptive epithelial cells, undifferentiated epithelial cells and goblet cells of the villi, and occasionally fibroblasts and endothelial cells of the lamina propria mucosae. Morphologic evidence indicated that virus multiplication occurred only in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum became dilated, and electron\u2010dense, granulo\u2010fibrillar material filled their cysternae to form smooth membrane\u2010bounded viral factories in the supranuclear cytoplasm of infected intestinal epithelial cells. Ultrastructural cytologic changes in this viral infection consisted of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum network, cellular ribosome depletion, extensive endoplasmic vacuolation and vesiculation of Golgi elements of intestinal epithelial cells, swelling and degeneration of mitochondria, loss of normal nuclear polarity with pyknosis and karyolysis of the nuclei, loss of cytoplasmic matrix, and a broad spectrum of pathologic changes involving the microvilli and terminal web.

Alle K\u00e4lber entwickelten Durchfall w\u00e4hrend der ersten 24 Stunden nach Inokulation. Vorhandensein und die Ausscheidung des Virus wurden elektronenoptisch verfolgt. Sichtbare Ver\u00e4nderungen waren gering und wenig auffallend. Der Darmtrakt war erweitert und enthielt eine gelbe, klare Fl\u00fcssigkeit. Die D\u00fcnndarmwand war d\u00fcnn und durchscheinend. Histologische Ver\u00e4nderungen waren charakterisiert durch Atrophie und Verschmelzung der Zotten, verminderte H\u00f6he und Vakuolisierung der intestinalen Epithelzellen, durch eine reduzierte Anzahl von Gobletzellen, Kryptenhypertrophie und \u2010erweiterung, sowie \u00d6dematisierung und erh\u00f6hte Zellularit\u00e4t der lamina propria mucusae. Ultrastrukturell infizierte das Virus die intestinalen absorptiven Epithelzellen, nichtdifferenzierte Epithelzellen und Gobletzellen der Zotten, und gelegentlich Fibroblasten sowie Endothelzellen der Lamina propria mucosae. Die morphologischen Ver\u00e4nderungen weisen darauf hin, da\u00df die Virusvermehrung nur im Zytoplasma infizierter Zellen stattfand.

Las modificaciones visibles eran escasas y se destacaban poco. El tracto intestinal se hallaba dilatado, conteniendo un l\u00edquido amarillo claro. La pared del intestino delgado era tenue y transl\u00facida. Las modificaciones histopatol\u00f3gicas se caracterizaban por atrofia y soldadura de las villosidades, altura reducida y vacuolizaci\u00f3n de las c\u00e9lulas epiteliales intestinales, por una cantidad reducida de c\u00e9lulas caliciformes, hipertrofia y ensanchamiento de las criptas, y por edematizaci\u00f3n y celularidad aumentada de la l\u00e1mina propia mucosa. El virus infectaba ultraestructuralmente las c\u00e9lulas epiteliales intestinales absortivas, c\u00e9lulas epiteliales no diferenciadas y c\u00e9lulas caliciformes de las villosidades, y, en ocasiones fibroblastos y c\u00e9lulas endoteliales de la l\u00e1mina propia mucosa. Las modificaciones morfol\u00f3gicas se\u00f1alan que la multiplicaci\u00f3n de virus solo tuvo lugar en el citoplasma de las c\u00e9lulas infectadas. El ret\u00edculo endoplasm\u00e1tico basto y fino se hallaba dilatado y material granulosofibrilar, opaco a los electrones, ocupaba las cisternas, las cuales formaban lugares finos de replicaci\u00f3n antiviral, ligados a las membranas en el \u00e1mbito citoplasm\u00e1tico supranuclear de c\u00e9lulas epiteliales intestinales infectadas.

Rotaviruses were detected on three farms, and coronavirus-like particles on two farms. In the same area, three other properties with past histories of rotavirus infection were also studied. Weekly examination of faeces from 10 calves from each property over a period of 5 weeks demonstrated that rotavirus excretion commenced at the same time as the onset of outbreaks of diarrhoea. On two of these rotavirus-positive farms, coronaviruses were also detected. At one farm, this coincided with rotavirus excretion and diarrhoea, and was associated with a more severe clinical disease but, on the other property, the coronavirus was unassociated with clinical disease. A similar study, carried out on a further property with a past history of coronavirus infection, showed that coronavirus excretion commenced simultaneously with the onset of an outbreak of diarrhoea. The virus was, however, detected in small numbers in 1 of 10 calves only. The results of the survey, coupled with previously gathered data, indicate that both viruses may be widespread in the cattle population. On some properties, rotavirus had a clear association with diarrhoea, but the relationship of coronavirus to diarrhoea was less well-established. \u00a9 1979, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Results have been compared with those obtained by complement fixation (CF), neutralization (Nt), and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests. The IAHA method has been shown to be as sensitive as the CF, Nt, and IHA tests in detecting cases of acute 229E infection. However, in a seroepidemiological survey of 343 healthy people of all ages, IAHA detected 229E antibody in 254 individuals (74.0%), Nt in 166 (48.3%), IHA in 89 (25.9%), and CF in 30 (8.7%). A study of the prevalence of coronavirus 229E IAHA antibody in the different age groups has shown that during the second decade of life nearly 100% of the population acquire this type of antibody, whereas only 50% are positive at the end of the first decade. In the older age groups, the high frequency of CF antibody (\u201cmarker\u201d of recent infection) indirectly confirms the high rate of 229E reinfections and the nonprotective nature of IAHA antibody. CF titer \u2a7e 1:8 in 90% of cases corresponded to IAHA titers \u2a7e 1:64. However, sera with IAHA titers of \u2a7e 1:128 were often CF\u2010negative. Recent 229E infections (or reinfections), as determined by the presence of CF antibody, were more frequent in April\u2010May than in October\u2010November. Three cases of acute infection showing 229E seroconversion (two adults and one child) were observed during the winter\u2010spring season. IAHA appears to be the test of choice for seroepidemiological surveys. Copyright \u00a9 1978 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company",

    "abstract": "A human coronavirus, strain OC 43, was propagated in suckling mouse brain and purified 5000-fold with, a 90% yield. Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized purified virus revealed a minimum of six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 191,000 (No. 1), 104,000 (No. 2), 60,000 (No. 3), 47,000 (No. 4), 30,000 (No. 5), and 15,000 daltons (No. 6). A seventh band was occasionally found in the 165,000-dalton region of the gels. Four polypeptides contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Polypeptide No. 5 comprised 26% of the total viral protein and glycopolypeptide No. 3 comprised 23%. Three other components accounted for most of the remaining protein: polypeptide No. 4 (16%), glycopolypeptide No. 6 (14%), and glycolipopolypeptide No. 1 (13%). Glycopolypeptide No. 2 was 8% of the total protein. Bromelin digestion of the viral projections (spikes) removed glycopolypeptides No. 2 and No. 6. Association of the remaining polypeptides with structural components of the virion is only tentatively postulated. The buoyant density in potassium tartrate of the bromelin-treated virus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/cm3. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (s020w) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 \u00b1 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MWa) was calculated to be 112 \u00b1 5 \u00d7 106 daltons. \u00a9 1972.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus 229E was grown to high titers in diploid fibroblast cells under medium containing twice the normal concentrations of amino acids and vitamins. Growth curves showed maximum virus production at multiplicities of infection of 0.1 and 1; maximum titers of intracellular virus occurred at 22-24 hr and of extracellular virus at 26 hr postadsorption. Tube infectivity titers ranged from 109.0-109.5 TCID50/ml and plaque titers from 1010.2-1010.9 y PFU/ml at the time of peak virus production, when no cytopathology was evident. Virus titer dropped rapidly between 26 and 56 hr, coincident with increasing cytopathology. A single precipitin band was observed in immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis between concentrated virus preparations and antiserum to purified 229E. Neuraminidase and hemagglutinin assays were negative. Virus was purified by two procedures: adsorption to and elution from human \"0\" erythrocytes and CaHPO4 gel followed by equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation, and PEG precipitation followed by equilibrium glycerol/tartrate gradients and rate zonal sucrose or glycerol/tartrate gradients. Final lots of purified virus containing <0.02% of the crude tissue culture proteins had absorption maxima at 256 nm and minima at 241.2 nm and a mean extinction coefficient of E1cm 1% = 54.3 at 256 nm. The fully corrected sedimentation coefficient for the intact virion was S20,v 0 = 381 S. PAGE by different techniques revealed seven polypeptides of mean apparent molecular weights between 16,900 and 196,100. Six contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Electropherograms of 3H- and 14C-labeled virus were identical to those of stained gels. Two glycoproteins constituting 25% of the virion protein were identified by bromelin digestion as the spike proteins.

The PLC treatment also reduced the apparent HI titres in some sera containing variable amounts of CF and/or HIG antibodies, but did not affect antibody determinations by the two latter methods.

Antigen grown in suckling mouse brain was used in all tests. Results obtained by the CF and HIG tests, and the RIA, were in good agreement with regard to the presence or absence of antibodies. Similar results were also obtained with the HI test if nonspecific haemagglutination inhibitors were first removed by treatment with phospholipase C and only titers of 1:20 or greater were considered positive. Children 6\u201323 months of age (n = 45) were without measurable coronavirus antibodies in all four assays. A rapid increase in the prevalence of antibodies then occurred in subsequent age groups, and practically all persons 6 years of age or older were found to have OC43 antibodies as measured by the HIG test or the RIA. The mean antibody levels determined by these two methods continued to increase, however, up to the age group of 10\u201314 years. This increase in antibody levels after the initial antibody incidence plateau may be due to boosting effects caused by related coronavirus strains, since OC43 antigens are known to cross\u2010react with antibodies induced by other human coronaviruses. Taken together, these data suggest that OC43 virus, or an antigenically related coronavirus strain, is very common in Finland. Copyright \u00a9 1978 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company",

Electron micrographs of HEV infected suckling mouse brain, prepared by negative staining and thin section techniques, exhibited typical morphological characteristics shared with other members of the Coronaviridae. The adaptation of HEV to suckling mouse brain facilitated serologic testing by the use of common host reagents and compatible animal systems. With hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, and neutralization tests, and antigenic relationship was demonstrated between human coronavirus OC 43 and HEV in specific immune and hyperimmune animal sera. Children and adults with seroconversion to OC 43 antigen had diagnostic rises in titer of antibody to HEV antigens. Individuals with seroconversion to human coronaviruses 229E and B814 demonstrated antibody to HEV but not diagnostic rises in titer. Swine with titers of antibody to HEV had lower or no detectable titers of antibody to coronavirus OC 43. Although the prevalence and geometric mean titer of antibody to OC 43 were higher than the titer of antibody to HEV in every group of normal humans tested, significant differences in antibody response to coronavirus OC 43 and HEV were seen between populations that did or did not have possible contact with swine. The evidence suggested that antibody to HEV in humans probably represented a heterologous response to infection with coronavirus OC 43.

The same serologic reagents were applied to nasopharyngeal secretion cells obtained from 106 infants and children hospitalized with respiratory tract disease and apparently not infected with conventional respiratory viruses. No coronavirus infections were detected by this method. It appears that coronavirus OC43 or 229E infections were not common in children in Tyneside hospitals during the period of study. However, fluorescence is a useful method for detection of coronavirus infections in symptomatic human subjects. Copyright \u00a9 1978 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company",

Peaks of infection were found in the winter and spring of 1966, 1968, and 1969; at other times, infections occurred sporadically. All age groups were involved, especially the very young. Rises in titer by CF and by HAI tests frequently did not occur together in the same individual. Agreement between the two tests was better in 1966 and 1969 than in the other years. A portion of the paired specimens showing rises in CF and/or HAI titer was tested by neutralization. Rises in neutralizing antibody were usually found in pairs collected in 1966 and 1969 but not in those collected in 1967 and 1968. The infecting viruses in 1966 and 1969 thus appeared more closely related to OC43 than did those in 1967 and 1968. (21 references.)",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus and FIPV were in turn antigenically related to human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E) and canine coronavirus (CCV). An interesting finding in the study was that the 8 coronaviruses selected for this study fell into one of two antigenically distinct groups. Viruses in each group were antigenically related to each other to varying degrees, but were antigenically unrelated to coronaviruses of the second group. The first antigenically related group was comprised of mouse hepatitis virus, type 3 (MHV-3), hemeagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus 67N (HEV-67N) of swine, calf diarrhea coronavirus (CDCV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HCV-OC43).

It induced the formation of syncytia in primary pig kidney cell cultures, caused hemadsorption and hemagglutination using chicken, turkey, rat and mouse erythrocytes. In growth curve experiments, infectious virus was produced intracellularly starting at 6 hours after inoculation and was followed by rapid release of the virus from the infected cells. The virus contains ribonucleic acid, is ether sensitive and has a size between 100 and 220 nm. At 37\u00b0 C, the infectivity titer decreased about 2 log10TCID50 per 24 hours. The viral population was heterogeneous as indicated by the rate of inactivation by U. V. irradiation and acid pH. Some hemagglutinating activity was left after complete loss of infectivity by ether-, temperature- and U. V. treatment. The VW 572 isolate is antigenically related if not identical to isolates from Canada, U. S. A. and England which were classified as a porcine coronavirus. Oronasal and intracerebral inoculation of the VW572 isolate in colostrum deprived pigs resulted in clinical disease after an incubation period of 6 and 4 days, respectively. Signs were characterized by depression, vomition, loss of appetence with rapid weakness in young pigs and vomition with progressive wasting in older pigs. Virus was isolated from nasal and pharyngeal swabs, nasal mucosa, tonsils, lungs and hind brains but not from rectal swabs or other organs tested. Virus could not be isolated later than 8 days after inoculation. Hemagglutination inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera at 6 days and 9 days after inoculation, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "About 14,000 paired sera, from patients with various types of acute infectious diseases with suspected viral origin, were screened by complement fixation against a wide set of viral antigens, including coronavirus OC43. A significant change in OC43 antibodies was recorded in 33 cases and a constant high titre, defined as a titre occurring in the respective age group in less than 1 % of all sera examined, was found in 45 cases. On the basis of careful retrospective analysis of hospital case records it was concluded that in 28 cases with an increase of OC43 antibody litres, and in two with titre decrease, a disease could be associated with an acute coronavirus infection. In 16 cases the disease was dominated by respiratory symptoms. Eight of these patients, four children and four adults, had pneumonia. Three of the eight pneumonia patients had, however, another concomitant infection, too. Four patients had neurological symptoms, one had severe perimyocarditis, and in five cases fever was the only symptom recorded. Among the patients with a statistically significant high titre of OC43 antibodies, there were 14 cases where a suggestive association with a disease could be envisaged on the basis of hospital records. Five of these patients had pneumonia. These results suggest that human coronaviruses, so far considered only as one group of causative agents of the common cold, may also be associated with other and more severe diseases in all age groups.

The characteristics of the biology and intracellular viral RNA synthesis and the intracellular viral protein synthesis of JHMV are discussed in the two previous papers, respectively. This paper describes the neuropathogenesis of JHMV and the isolation and characterization of 34 temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV. These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i. = 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5\u00b0 as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33\u00b0. N-Methyl-N\u2032-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and 5-fluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90-95%. Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5\u00b0; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation. RNA-minus ( 17 34), RNA-intermediate ( 14 34), and RNA-plus ( 3 34) groups were defined. One mutant, N3, produces chronic meningitis and demyelination without typical JHMV encephalitis in spite of the fact that neurons are infected as detected by immunofluorescence. This altered neuropathogenesis cannot be explained by \"leakiness\" or reversion. In addition, non-temperature-sensitive variants of JHMV have been selected for altered neuropathogenesis and are described. \u00a9 1979.",

JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5\u00b0. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 \u03bcg/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species. The virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species that is resistant to 10 mM EDTA, presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein, has a sedimentation value in sucrose of about 230 S for JHMV and 200 S for A59V. The species of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein that are sensitive to 10 mM EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein, are about 40-100 S in sucrose for both viruses. The purified presumptive virion RNA is about 50 S in sucrose for both viruses. The major species of presumptive mRNA of both viruses is about 18 S with secondary species of about 28 S in sucrose. Denaturation of the virus-specific RNA with heat and dimethylsulfoxide does not appreciably alter the sedimentation profiles of either the presumptive virion RNA or mRNA species. \u00a9 1979.",

    "abstract": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was radiolabeled for its nucleic acid component by growth in deembryonated chicken eggs. Purified virions of IBV have a buoyant density in linear sucrose gradients of 1.17-1.18 g/cm3 and contain approximately 4% RNA by weight. The genomic ribonucleic acid of IBV shows the following characteristic: (1) It consists of one size class of single-stranded RNA having a molecular weight of 5.5-5.7 x 108 and a sedimentation coefficient of about 48 S; (2) no evidence for subunit structure is apparent since the RNA resolves as a single species with the same electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels before and after heat denaturation; (3) at least 20-30% of the RNA molecules extracted from purified virions contain sequences of polyadenylic acid of approximately 4 S size; (4) RNA obtained from detergent-disrupted virus particles by phenol-chloroform extraction is infectious for cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts, giving rise to progeny virus which is lethal for embryonated eggs. These findings, together with the observation that IBV virions do not exhibit detectable transcriptase activity, support the conclusion that the genome of this coronavirus acts directly as a messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. \u00a9 1977.",

    "abstract": "Two species of membrane-associated glycoproteins have been identified in the coronavirus virion. They are readily distinguished on the basis of size, radiolabeling characteristics, and location in relation to the lipid bilayer. The larger glycoprotein is highly labeled by both radiolabeled fucose and glucosamine. This species is found in two forms, GP180 and GP90, with apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 90,000. GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GP180 give identical peptide patterns. Based on pronase and bromelain sensitivities, GP180/90 is the only protein which is located entirely external to the viral envelope. It appears to comprise the characteristic long, petal-shaped peplomers of the virion. The smaller glycoprotein, GP23, has an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 and is labeled by radiolabeled glucosamine but not by fucose. The level of glucosamine-labeling of GP23 is about 1/10 that of GP180/90. GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate containing region which is found outside the viral envelope, and a larger portion, highly labeled by methionine, which is integrally associated with the viral membrane. A new nomenclature is proposed for the three major coronavirus structural proteins. The two envelope glycoproteins, GP23 and GP180/90 are designated E1 and E2, respectively; the inner core protein, VP50, is designated N. \u00a9 1977.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus A59 possesses four size classes of structural proteins which have apparent molecular weights measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of 23,000 (GP23), 50,000 (VP50), 90,000 (GP90), and 180,000 (GP180). VP50 is the only structural protein which is completely unaffected by protease treatment of intact virions. This species is the most highly labeled by polar amino acids such as glutamic acid and arginine and it is probably associated with the viral nucleocapsid. GP90, GP180, and GP23 are membrane-associated proteins. However, after protease treatment of virions, only 20% of the GP23 molecule is digested, whereas all of the GP90 and GP180 are removed. GP90 and GP180 appear to comprise most of the prominent layer of characteristic projections on the external surface of the viral envelope. The major portion of GP23 is presumed to lie within the lipid envelope, protected from protease digestion. GP23 and the protease resistant portion, p*18, exhibit anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE. After heating to 100\u00b0 in SDS the electrophoretic mobility of these polypeptides is altered and several new forms of lower mobility are produced. \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol exaggerate the effects of heating. \u00a9 1977.",

    "abstract": "The hemagglutination (HA) and receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) activities of a newly isolated mouse enteric coronavirus (designated as DVIM) are described. DVIM agglutinates mouse or rat red blood cells (RBC) at 4\u00b0 C. At 37\u00b0 C the agglutination was rapidly reversed. The optimal pH for HA and for RDE activities using mouse red cells were shown to be 6.5 and 7.3 respectively. Hemagglutination by DVIM was not inhibited by pretreatment of RBCs with Vibrio cholerae filtrate or by pretreatment with Influenza-A neuraminidase. Therefore, the DVIM receptors on RBCs differ from the receptors of Influenza-A, and the RDE activity of DVIM acts specifically on this receptor. In addition, an analysis of the DVIM polypeptides showed that the virions contain five major, VP1 (M. W. 139,000), VP2 (68,000), VP3 (53,000), VP4 (38,000), VP5 (22,000) and two minor, VP1a (110,000), VP1b (100,000) polypeptides. VP1 and VP1b were digested by bromelain, suggesting that they constitute the surface glycoproteins. ",

The complex was highly susceptible to heat, releasing 4 S RNA fragments at 37\u00b0 and breaking down to fragments of 4-70 S at 60\u00b0; it was also degraded by centrifugation through dimethyl sulfoxide gradients. Unlike tobacco mosaic virus or Rous sarcoma virus RNA, OC-43 RNA prepared by extraction with phenol-SDS or phenol-chloroform degraded into a range of fragments with coefficients of 15-55 S; 4 S RNA was also present as a minor component. This suggests that (a) extensive nicking of a large RNA molecule has occurred during viral growth, due to ribonucleases which are inactivated during phenol extractions; (b) heterogeneity for OC-43 RNA is not due to internal ribonuclease activity and fragments are held together by noncovalent linkages much weaker than those present in the 70 S retroviral RNA complex, or by small proteins; or, most probably, (c) a combination of extensive nicking and weak noncovalent linkages results in the heterogeneous denaturation products. \u00a9 1977.",

The new strains demonstrated a corona-virus like morphology, haemagglutinated chicken red cells and were sensitive to sodium desoxycholate. Multiplication with CPE was demonstrated in BHK 21/c13 and BSC-1 cells, and without CPE in Vero and GMK cell cultures. The mouse pathogenicity was relatively low. In gel precipitation three to five specific lines were seen. Precipitating antibodies have been found in seabird species commonly infested by I. uriae. The ecological circumstances of the isolates indicate an earlier unrecognized arbovirus circulating between seabirds and I. uriae. This corona-like virus has been tentatively termed Runde virus. ",
