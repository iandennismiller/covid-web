    <p>
        Coronavirus Index (<a href="http://covindex.com">CoV Index</a>) is a map of coronavirus research and researchers.
        <b>CoV Index</b> work uses network analysis, bibliometrics, and computational linguistics to identify communities of Coronavirus research.
        The primary goal of <b>CoV Index</b> is to organize Coronavirus research so scientists from other disciplines can engage with the Coronavirus research community.

    <h2>Interdisciplinary Coronavirus Research</h2>

    <p>
        For decades, Coronavirus research has occurred in the biological sciences and, to some extent, public health/epidemiology - but now other kinds of researchers are paying attention.
        With the outbreak of COVID-19, Coronavirus research is likely to encompass many new disciplines due to the impact Coronavirae have upon society, economy, politics, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>CoV Index</b> bridges the gaps between academic disciplines.
        In this project, we analyze networks of articles and researchers to build an index of interconnected Coronavirus resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Collaboration Network</h2>

    <p>
        The network of Coronavirus collaborators was extracted from a set of approximately 4000 articles.
        Any time researchers co-authored an article together, a network edge is created between them.
        The preliminary results are visualized below.
