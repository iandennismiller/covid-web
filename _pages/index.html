    <p>
        Coronavirus Index (<a href="http://covindex.com">CoVIndex</a>) is a project that maps networks of coronavirus research and researchers.
        CoVIndex is a resource for discovering new connections in the literature.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="./articles/">articles</a>: browse all articles in the index.</li>
        <li><a href="./data/coronavirus.bib">coronavirus.bib</a>: BibTeX file containing all citations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interdisciplinary Coronavirus Research</h2>

    <p>
        For decades, Coronavirus research has occurred in the biological sciences and, to some extent, public health/epidemiology - but now other kinds of researchers are paying attention.
        With the outbreak of COVID-19, Coronavirus research is likely to encompass many new disciplines due to the impact Coronavirae have upon society, economy, politics, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
        CoVIndex bridges the gaps between academic disciplines.
        In this project, we analyze networks of articles and researchers to build an index of interconnected Coronavirus resources.
