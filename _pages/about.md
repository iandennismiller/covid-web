<p>
    Coronavirus Index (<a href="http://covindex.com">CoV Index</a>) is a map of coronavirus research and researchers.
    <b>CoV Index</b> work uses network analysis, bibliometrics, and computational linguistics to identify communities of Coronavirus research.
    The primary goal of <b>CoV Index</b> is to organize Coronavirus research so scientists from other disciplines can engage with the Coronavirus research community.
</p>

<h2>Interdisciplinary Coronavirus Research</h2>

<p>
    For decades, Coronavirus research has occurred in the biological sciences and, to some extent, public health/epidemiology - but now other kinds of researchers are paying attention.
    With the outbreak of COVID-19, Coronavirus research is likely to encompass many new disciplines due to the impact Coronavirae have upon society, economy, politics, and more.
</p>

<p>
    <b>CoV Index</b> bridges the gaps between academic disciplines.
    In this project, we analyze networks of articles and researchers to build an index of interconnected Coronavirus resources.
</p>

<h2>Collaboration Network</h2>

<p>
    The network of Coronavirus collaborators was extracted from a set of approximately 4000 articles.
    Any time researchers co-authored an article together, a network edge is created between them.
    The preliminary results are visualized below.
