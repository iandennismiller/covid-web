[CoV Index](http://covindex.com) provides a map of Coronavirus Science, including *Research*, Research *Communities*, and *Researchers*.

**CoV Index** applies network analysis, bibliometrics, computer-human interaction, and computational linguistics methods to identify communities of Coronavirus research.

The primary goal of **CoV Index** is to support the comprehension of the massive - and growing - scientific archive of Coronavirus research.
**CoV Index** seeks to organize Coronavirus Science so experts from any discipline can engage with Coronavirus Science.

## Interdisciplinary Coronavirus Research

With the outbreak of COVID-19, Coronavirus research is gaining relevance to many scientific disciplines due to the impact Coronaviruses have upon society, economy, politics, psychology, and beyond.
**CoV Index** bridges the gaps between academic disciplines.
In this project, we analyze networks of scientific articles and researchers to build an index of interconnected Coronavirus resources.

## Collaboration Network

The network of Coronavirus collaborators was extracted from a set of approximately 4000 articles.
Any time researchers co-authored an article together, a network edge is created between them.
The preliminary results are visualized below.

## Contact

The [CoV Index](http://covindex.com) project is directed by <a href="http://imiller.utsc.utoronto.ca">Dr. Ian Dennis Miller</a>, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto.
Dr. Miller's previous research has investigated scientific progress as a memetic, network process; other work has applied computational linguistic methods to identify memes within a corpus of political speech.
