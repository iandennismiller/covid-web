[CoV Index]({{site.url}}/{{ site.baseurl }}) provides a map of Coronavirus Science, including *Research*, Research *Communities*, and *Researchers*.

**CoV Index** applies network analysis, bibliometrics, computer-human interaction, and computational linguistics methods to identify communities of Coronavirus research.

The primary goal of **CoV Index** is to support the comprehension of the massive - and growing - scientific archive of Coronavirus research.
**CoV Index** seeks to organize Coronavirus Science so experts from any discipline can engage with Coronavirus Science.

## Interdisciplinary Coronavirus Research

With the outbreak of COVID-19, Coronavirus research is gaining relevance to many scientific disciplines due to the impact Coronaviruses have upon society, economy, politics, psychology, and beyond.
**CoV Index** bridges the gaps between academic disciplines.
In this project, we analyze networks of scientific articles and researchers to build an index of interconnected Coronavirus resources.

## Collaboration Network

The network of Coronavirus collaborators was extracted from a set of approximately 4000 articles.
Any time researchers co-authored an article together, a network edge is created between them.
The preliminary results are visualized below.

## Contact

The [CoV Index]({{site.url}}/{{ site.baseurl }}) project is directed by [Dr. Ian Dennis Miller](https://twitter.com/iandennismiller), a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Toronto](http://imiller.utsc.utoronto.ca).
Dr. Miller's previous research has investigated scientific enterprise as a memetic, network process; other work has applied computational linguistic methods to identify memes within a corpus of political speech.
